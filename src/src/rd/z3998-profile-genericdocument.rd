    <p>The Z39.98-2012 Generic Document Profile can be used to represent a wide range of
    documents, typically such that are not targeted by the more specific of the Z39.98-2012 profiles.</p>
    
    <p>Examples of generic documents, targeted by this profile, include:</p>
    <ul>
    	<li>Organisation meeting minutes</li>
    	<li>Schedules, proceedings</li>
    	<li>Information leaflets</li>
    	<li>Letters</li>
    	<li>Documents off the web</li> 
    </ul>
    
    <p>Being generic, this profile can also be used as a template starting point for creators of more 
     specific Z39.98-2012 Authoring and Interchange profiles.</p>
