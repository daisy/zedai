                <h>Foreword</h>
                <p>This is the place where the author typically explains why he or she wanted to write
                    the book. Also a natural place to mention what the reader might expect from the
                    book. </p>
                <p>A foreword might very well contain several paragraphs, but this one has only got
                    two.</p>

                <section>
                    <h>A little bit of the beginning</h>
                    <p><d:s>As this is only a little bit of the beginning, it can't be too long.</d:s><d:s> But small as
                        it is, it must be possible to <em>emphasize</em> what you mean, and even use
                        some <strong>strong</strong> language, if that feels natural.</d:s></p>
                    <p>And I can't see why a little bit of the beginning can't contain a list, so here
                        it is:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This is an important point to state.</li>
                        <li>And so is this!</li>
                        <li>But this is the final and most important one!!!</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>And that list marks the end of this section.</p>

                <section>
                    <h>More about the beginning</h>
                    <p>This is an obvious place to present a table.</p>
                    <table>
                        <caption>The table in the beginning</caption>
                        <tr>

                            <td>Extremely high</td>
                            <td>Definitely a higher density than today</td>
                            <td>A suitable energy density for nurturing life. We don't get fried, and we
                                don't freeze to death.</td>

                    </table>
                    <d:pagebreak value="2"/>
                    <p>There is certainly nothing like a good tabular presentation in a leisure book!</p>

                    <h>The end of the beginning</h>
                    <p>Sorry! I couldn't help it. The heading seemed so obvious.</p>

                <h>Chapter 2: The part inbetween</h>
                <p>According to must writers, this is the tricky part. 
                    The reader is now expecting some action, or at least something more exciting than the beginning. 
                    And that will be very difficult in this book, taking into consideration that the beginning of this
                    book aktually was extremely breathtaking.</p>
                
                <section>
                    <h>A few ords about lists</h>
                    <p>Normally you don't find many lists in a leisure book, something but in this one you have already encountered one. 
                        And that was just in the beginning. There is more to come.....</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>This is the first item in a numbered list</li>
                        <li>This is the second item. And this item presents a sub-list:
                            <ol>
                                <li>The first sub-list item is not very interesting.</li>
                                <li>The next one is.</li>
                                <li>The last item is just that; the last item.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>Why is it that most, or perhaps even all, lists in this document operates with three list items?</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>The list above was not wrapped into a p element, but the next list is:
                        <ul>
                            <li>This is the first item in an un-numbered list</li>
                            <li>This is the second item. And this item presents a sub-list:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>The first sub-list item is not very interesting.</li>
                                    <li>The next one is.</li>
                                    <li>The last item is just that; the last item.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Why is it that most, or perhaps even all, lists in this document operates with three list items?</li>
                        </ul>
                        and the normal text continues here. Oh no, there is no more space on this page!
                        
                        <d:pagebreak value="4"/>
                        Uh, that was <strong>close</strong>! What a relief, a blank and completely unspoiled page, for me and my words only.
                        This universe is truly a good place to be.
