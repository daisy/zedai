        <attribute name="skipcontent">
            <a:documentation> This attribute controls whether the content of an element is evaluated
                or should be skipped. * If a new element is introduced in a future version of
                language allowing markup from a previous version of the language as element content,
                the skip-content attribute controls whether this content is processed by the user
                agent. * If an empty element in a version of a language becomes non-empty in a
                future SMIL version, the skip-content attribute controls whether this content is
                ignored by a user agent, or results in a syntax error. If the value of the
                skip-content attribute is true, and one of the cases above apply, the content of the
                element is ignored. If the value is false, the content of the element is processed.
                The default value for skip-content is true.</a:documentation>
