        <h1>Introduction to the Z39.86-2011 Strict XHTML profile</h1>

            <h2>Unique Traits</h2>
            <section id="section-hx">
                <h3>Sections and headings</h3>
                <p>To mimic the cozy warm feeling of the DTBook <code>level</code> element, this profile elevates the 
                    <code>section</code> and <code>hx</code> elements to a special status:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>the <code>section</code> element is used solely to encapsulate major
                        structural portions of the document (i.e. <code>section</code> alone
                        constructs the document outline)</li>
                    <li>a <code>section</code> can contain 0 or 1 h1-h6. Sections without a heading
                        are equally structurally significant as those with a heading</li>
                    <li>the <code>body</code> element has the content model of a top-level section,
                        and is thus the only element that can contain 0 or 1 <code>h1</code></li>
                    <li>The use of h1-h6 must follow proper nesting (e.g. section children of body
                        can only use <code>h2</code> etc)</li>
                </ul>

                <p>The <code>div</code> element is considered a structurally less significant, and
                    is used for grouping in contexts (typically Flow) where sections are not
                    allowed.</p>
                
            </section>
            <section id="flow-content">
                <h3>Flow content</h3>
                <p>As compared to loose (X)HTML, Flow content is of an <em>either-or</em> nature. This means
                    that the children of list items and table cells for example, must be either inline or block,
                    but not both at the same time at time.</p>
            </section>
            <section id="empty-elements">
                <h3>Empty elements</h3>
                <p>Certain elements, such as <code>p</code>, are not allowed to be empty. A <code>p</code> with only
                whitespace is also considered invalid. (TODO -- this may be a req on loose as well).</p>
            </section>  
            <section id="compound-additions">
                <h3>Non-XHTML namespace elements</h3>
