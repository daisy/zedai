      <title>Introduction</title>
      
      <para>
         It is safe to say that DTBs have passed the phase of their existence where they can still be 
         called a new technology. DTBs are now ubiquitous, and the technologies they introduced, like the 
         Navigation Control for XML Applications (NCX), have been adopted into other standards,
         deeply entrenching the specification in the global publishing ecosystem.
         Even the original expansion "Digital Talking Book" no longer truly encapsulates the breadth of DTBs as
         an accessible format, but the acronym persists exactly because of the strong association
         that people now make between it and all forms of accessible publishing.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         There is always room to improve and always the need to evolve the DTB specification to keep up
         with the pace of technological change as the publishing industry moves more deeply into the digital
         world, however. To keep relevant and to ensure users are still receiving the best possible reading 
         experience, a new revision of the specification was undertaken by the DAISY Consortium. Some of 
         the key issues that this new version of the specification addresses are as follows:
      </para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <emphasis>It brings greater distribution flexibility.</emphasis> The new specification allows multiple 
               versions of a DTB to be distributed in a single release, so users can choose which format type
               they prefer to read.
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <emphasis>It brings greater production flexibility.</emphasis> The specification provides greater 
               format diversity, so readers and developers are no longer saddled with SMIL synchronization support 
               when they don't need or use it, for example.
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <emphasis>It tightens the scope.</emphasis> The specification no longer
               tries to be every accessible output in one. Part A of the specification replaces DTBook as a means 
               of facilitating accessible text production and DTBs once again focus on their specific target audience.
            </para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>
               <emphasis>It re-aligns the specification with standard technologies.</emphasis> Developers are
               no longer required to create custom components to process non-standard technologies, such
               as having to build custom browsers to display content. This change is expected both to simplify
               the creation of new accessible readers and to facilitate the playback of DTBs in mainstream readers.

         The <link xlink:href="Z3986-2011B.html">Z39.86 Distribution Framework specification</link> is not the 
         optimal place to detail these and other changes
         that have been implemented, which is where this primer document comes it. This documents represents
         a simpler entry point into the technologies and concepts for readers who may be new to DTBs or who may 
         produce or distribute DTB content but do not require an intimate understanding of all the requirements 
         and restrictions outlined in the specification.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         The primer does not provide any new information that is not already in the specification, but endeavors
         to present the information in a way that anyone with an interest in DTBs will be able to follow and
         understand. References to the relevant sections in the specification have been included wherever possible.

   <chapter xml:id="dtb">
      <title>What is a DTB?</title>
      
      <para> A DTB, stripped bare, is nothing more than a collection of electronic resources.
         When taken together, however, those resources allow a document to be rendered in 
         one or more ways conducive to persons unable to read traditional print media. The use 
         of the statement <emphasis>conducive to</emphasis> here is very much intentional, 
         as DTBs are intended to be useful to all digital readers, whatever their abilities.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         Persons new to the accessibility field often arrive with the mistaken notion that a format 
         that assists one segment of the population with reading must by necessity come burdened 
         with aids and devices that would limit or exclude its use by another. Nothing could be farther
         from the truth when it comes to DTBs, however. If anything, the technology was ahead of 
         its time, providing a synchronized text and audio reading experience long before the audiobook 
         and eBook revolution that's taken off in mainstream publishing in the last few years.
      </para>
      
      <para>
         There are no limits on what type of document a DTB can represent &#8212; books, 
         magazines, articles from journals, a memo to employees, anything that can be written
         can be converted to a DTB.
      </para>
      
      <para> A DTB may be distributed as an audio-only publication (a structured "talking
         book"), a text-only document (e.g. an EPUB document), or it may blend features of
         both formats (synchronized text and audio). It may also layer video and SVG
         graphics, thereby enabling a richer multimedia experience. This new version of the
         specification also allows all of these formats to be combined and distributed in a
         single publication unit, allowing end users and/or reading systems to pick the most
         adequate consumption format. </para>
      
      <para> A DTB created in accordance with this standard makes possible a wide range of
         features: </para>
      
      <itemizedlist>
         <listitem>
            <para>rapid, flexible navigation (hierarchical or flat-listed);</para>
         </listitem>
         <listitem>
            <para>synchronized playback (e.g. text and audio narration, text and video sign
               language, etc.);</para>

               page numbers, etc.).</para>
         </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      
      <para> Such features enable readers with visual and physical disabilities to access the
         information in DTBs flexibly and efficiently, and allow sighted users with learning
         or reading disabilities to receive the information through multiple senses. </para>

   <chapter xml:id="dtbIntro_types">
      <title>What are the DTB types?</title>
      
      <para>Each type of DTB presented in this document offers unique characteristics
         dedicated to fulfilling specific operational requirements. However, there is also a
         degree of functional overlap. In order to avoid redundant normative prose in this
         specification, commonalities are described in independent sections that provide
         generalized definitions applying to more than one type of DTB. In some cases, the
         formal definition specific to a type of DTB may enforce particular restrictions to
         the rules inherited from the generalized definition.</para>
      
      <para>This specification details four types of DTBs:</para>

      <title>What's in a DTB?</title>
      
      <para> 
         Although DTBs are made up of many resources, not all DTBs will contain the same types of resources.
         It is true, for example, that every DTB provides navigation through the inclusion of an NCX file and contains 
         a package file listing its contents, but with four types of DTBs it may confusing to understand why
         other resources are included in some DTBs and not in others (even within a single DTB type).
