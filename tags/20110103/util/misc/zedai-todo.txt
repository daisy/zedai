==SPEC==
* spec needs versioning def for vocabs. 
* [part of PA feature behavior workover]: need a general informative statement about PAs having a pass-through mode for supported features due to the nature of pipelines. This would logically sit on top of the behavioral fallbacks that the Feature RDs define.
* [wait with until we know more about RDFa 1.1 adoption] what do we say about PA reqs re RDFa (separation of @role vs RDFa behavioral reqs... section 10.4 ) 
* verify whether the static segment of the profile URI is still needed now that profiles are explicitly identified in the meta

== WWW ==
* @markus replace RD css link with a link to SVN

== SAMPLE DOCS ==

== SCHEMAS overarching ==
* @markus: recheck all dcterms module requires fields (diagnostics.xml)
* @markus write test: assure consistent use of chameleon
* [part of note/annotation/object redesign]: consider allowing annotation in head (when they are not intended to be part of the document content generally)
* @Matt run the rng-element-schematron-text-test target in diagnostics.xml and add the non-empty sch test to elements that need it (which is not all that are listed, and ignore all mathml elements)

== MODULES ==
* @markus applies  to <name> and <abbr>: 
<define name="z3986.name.extra.class" combine="choice">
      <choice>
        <ref name="z3986.span"/> <!-- TODO this needs to be fixed, this reopens Phrase.class, if anything a Text.class variant of span is needed -->
      </choice>
</define>
* every instance doc must contain at least one <h>??
* are the semantics of the separator element clear (consider another name for context break aspect)

== FEATURES ==
* ruby: the feature-recognized behavior for ruby may be wrong (rely on <rp> if present?)
* ruby: is in text.class but absdef claims allows phrase members?
* make sure all feature RDs have "The namespace of all members of the Source Rendition feature element/attribute set is..."
* Update xforms rng schema?
* [asking Dedicon and TPB] ssml: Really make x-SAMPA implicit default? SSML spec says that absence of @alphabet is processor-specific (we may want to avoid overriding that)
* ?? ssml: make Text.class versions of phoneme and token, replacing the contrib to name.extra.class => no, the problem is the content model of name
* select: could reserve prefixes for the built-in function sets as to not have to declare them in the instance. Any other function set <-> prefix assoc must be explicitly declared in head using the prescribed mechanism.
* review and standardize the prose in the feature definitions, esp. use of ignore/remove

== PROFILES ==

== CM =

== SCHEMADOC ==
* need snippets for more attributes
* need longdesc for <name> to markup person-name; the example should use @typeof and @property; core.n3 contribs all these props to <name>, whereas the sample uses span for the subcomponents.
* need longdesc for bibliography/entry, show how to add dcterms metadata to an entry


== RDs ==

== VOCABS ==
* repopulate all role contribs (TODO: section, block, aside, notes, titles, ref (continuation))
* deal with running headers issue (<meta>) as per list
* [note may be able to use RDFa 1.1 constructs] move the 'prefix' prop from rd vocab to decl?
* [@markus add issue] decl: remove the ability to define external function sets, just have the built-in functions

== XSD ==

== MORE SAMPLES IN /test/ ==
http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F9.1&viewtype=text&pageseq=1

== LOW PRIO ==
* update CSS to cover CMP and feature components
* modules: how do recommend marking up addresses of different kinds?
* vocabs: Note that the longdesc on <p> talks about pgroup. OTOH block@pgroup does not say anything more than a block with only p children
* <definition>: should there be a block version of definition also?
* spec: do we need something like: "PAs are not required to recognize role values that specify semantics identical to elements in CMP, eg not required to recognize <span role="cite"> as an equivalent to <cite>.
* vocabs: option to establish a relation between CMP elements and core vocab: element section "is-a" core vocab #section, etc
* table: th@abbr also on td?
* list type="ordered" ==> these could be vocab properties instead
* abbr @type: ==> these should be vocab properties instead, as the list is not finite
* modules: make all occurrences of "implicit value" in module RDF a link to spec
* modules: add more regexes for datatypes inc ssml:datatypes (perhaps port the html ones too, for dist)
* RD: generate Oasis catalogs, add property 'oasis-catalog' in RD vocab
* vocabs: add owl:sameAs to xhv, aria, etc (Marisa had these)
* add ref to RDDL? GRDDL? in "relation to other specifications" to avoid "why dont you use that instead of RD" questions


== NEEDED LONGDESCS ==
the multiple facets of annotation
the ref element (using it for both resolving and unresolving references, and re links for both IDREFs and URIs)
object
