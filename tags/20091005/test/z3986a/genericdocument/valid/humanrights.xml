            <section>
                <quote> On December 10, 1948 the General Assembly of the United Nations adopted and
                    proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights the full text of which
                    appears in the following pages. Following this historic act the Assembly called
                    upon all Member countries to publicize the text of the Declaration and
                    &quot;to cause it to be disseminated, displayed, read and expounded
                    principally in schools and other educational institutions, without distinction
                    based on the political status of countries or territories.&quot;</quote>

                <h>PREAMBLE</h>
                <p> Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable
                    rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice
                    and peace in the world, </p>

                <p> Whereas disregard and contempt for human rights have resulted in barbarous acts
                    which have outraged the conscience of mankind, and the advent of a world in
                    which human beings shall enjoy freedom of speech and belief and freedom from
                    fear and want has been proclaimed as the highest aspiration of the common
                    people, </p>
                <p> Whereas it is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a
                    last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights
                    should be protected by the rule of law, </p>
                <p> Whereas it is essential to promote the development of friendly relations between
                    nations,</p>
                <p> Whereas the peoples of the United Nations have in the Charter reaffirmed their
                    faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person
                    and in the equal rights of men and women and have determined to promote social
                    progress and better standards of life in larger freedom, </p>
                <p> Whereas Member States have pledged themselves to achieve, in co-operation with
                    the United Nations, the promotion of universal respect for and observance of
                    human rights and fundamental freedoms, </p>

                <p>Whereas a common understanding of these rights and freedoms is of the greatest
                    importance for the full realization of this pledge,</p>
                <p><emph>Now, Therefore THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY proclaims THIS UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF
                        HUMAN RIGHTS</emph> as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and
                    all nations, to the end that every individual and every organ of society,
                    keeping this Declaration constantly in mind, shall strive by teaching and
                    education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive
                    measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective
                    recognition and observance, both among the peoples of Member States themselves
                    and among the peoples of territories under their jurisdiction.</p>
