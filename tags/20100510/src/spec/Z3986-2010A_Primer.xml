         <title>Default namespace</title>
         <para> Z39.86-AI documents may contain a mixture of many different markup
            languages to express different kinds of content. In order to keep these
            straight, all Z39.86-AI documents use <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML
            namespaces</link>. But while the different namespaces that may be used in
            a Z39.86-AI document may vary, all Z39.86-AI documents must use the same
            default namespace, which is the namespace for the Z39.86-2010 core
            markup: <code>http://www.daisy.org/ns/z3986/authoring/</code>. In our example
            document, this default namespace is declared on the root
               <code>document</code> element. </para>

         <title>Identifying profiles</title>
         <para>Every Z39.86-AI document references a Z39.86-AI profile.  A profile
            defines markup designed to support the creation of XML documents from a
            particular type of information resource.  Simple books, periodicals,
            newspapers, textbooks, and examinations all might require different XML
            vocabularies in order to be fully and clearly expressed in an XML
            document.  Therefore, each of these kinds of resources could have a
            different Z39.86-AI profile that provides the tools necessary for
            document authors.</para>
         <para>Our example document references the "generic document" profile, one of
            the profiles defined by the Z39.86-2010 specification, using the
               <code>meta</code> element:</para>
         <example>
            <title>Identifying the profile</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-profile-identification'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para>The <code>rel</code> attribute value of <code>"decl:profile"</code>
            here indicates that this <code>meta</code> element is a profile
            declaration. The prefix <code>decl</code> is declared in the
               <code>document</code> element, and points to the Z39.86-2010 Instance
            Metadata Vocabulary (we will describe vocabularies and how to reference
            them in <xref linkend="semantics" />). As you can also see in the
            example, profiles are identified by a unique URI, given in the
               <code>resource</code> attribute of the <code>meta</code> element.  The
            URI for each profile is defined by the agency that created and maintains
            that profile (in this case, the DAISY Consortium).</para>
         <section xml:id="profilesIdentifyingRD">
            <title>Profile resources</title>
            <para>At its core, a profile defines specific XML markup to be used for
               documents.  This markup is defined using one or more normative
               schemas, written in a schema language such as RelaxNG.  There may be
               other resources associated with a profile, such as translated W3C XML
               Schemas, and stylesheets. We will touch on other profile resources
               later on in this primer.</para>
            <para> Beyond uniquely identifying the profile, the profile URI points to
               a location on the Internet that contains a resource directory for the
               profile.  This resource directory contains all the information related
               to the profile and is described using XHTML+RDFa (as defined in <link
                  xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa in XHTML:
                  Syntax and Processing</link>).   Resource directory documents are
               thus based on XHTML, which means that they can be viewed in a web
               browser.  The document will typically have a description of the
               purpose of the profile, links to the normative schema and other
               profile resources, and to any associated specification documents.
                   <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/"
                  >XHTML+RDFa</link> documents are also machine-readable, which means
               that they can be used by systems that process Z39.86-AI documents to
               discover necessary schemas and other resources at run time. In sum, by
               following the profile link appearing in the head of the document, any
               person or processing system can find all the information available
               about that profile.</para>
            <para>Here is a partial example of the source for a resource
               directory:</para>
            <example>
               <title>Profile resource directory (partial)</title>
               <programlisting xml:space="preserve"><xi:include href="./examples/z3986a-genericdocument.html" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example>
            <para> The various resources for the profile are identified as the
               targets of links within this  <link
                  xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">XHTML+RDFa</link>
               document. The nature of each resource being linked to is identified
               using the <code>rel</code> attribute of the <code>a</code> element.
               The normative schema for the profile, for example, is found by
               following the link with the <code>rel</code> value of
                  <code>rd:normative-schema</code>. </para>
         </section>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="profilesMetadata">
         <title>Metadata</title>
         <para> As with XHTML and earlier versions of Z39.86, Z39.86-AI documents
            contain metadata in the document head. There is an intentionally small
            set of required metadata items: <token>unique identifier</token>,
               <token>publisher</token>, and <token>date</token> (the latter also
            serving as a version identifier). </para>
         <example>
            <title>Basic document: metadata</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-basic-document-metadata'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para>As is described further in <xref linkend="metadataInDetail" />,
            Z39.86-AI documents allow you to associate metadata resources with the
            document. These resources are intended to contain more "complete"
            metadata about the document (and, as sometimes needed in a republishing
            context, about the document source). </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="profilesContent">
         <title>The document content</title>
         <para>Following the profile identification and metadata in the document head
            comes our minimal document content: a single heading, expressed with the
               <code>h</code> element. This comes from the Z39.86-2010 core markup,
            and hence does not need a further namespace identification. The
            Z39.86-2010 core markup defines a few basic elements and attributes that
            are likely to be used in all profiles. The elements defined here include
            all the basic structural elements (<code>head</code>, <code>body</code>)
            and attributes that are needed throughout Z39.86-AI documents, such as
               <code>xml:id</code>
            <code>role</code>. For our minimal document, no further markup is needed,
            and hence no schema modules outside the Z39.86-2010 core are used.
         </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="profilesValidation">
         <title>Validating the document</title>
         <para> That is all there is to the document, which is nevertheless a
            completely valid, conforming Z39.86-AI document. For those used to DTDs,
            the lack of a doctype and system identifier may raise the question of how
            one validates this document.</para>
         <para>As we saw in <xref linkend="profilesIdentifyingRD" />, the profile's
            resource directory (found at the profile identification URI in the
            document head) defines at least one normative schema to use in validating
            the document. The way in which the schema validation process takes place
            depends on the schema language(s) used, and which tools are used to
            perform the validation.</para>
         <para>The profile's resource directory can also reference informative
            schemas or DTDs, that allow authoring and (to a certain extent)
            validation within a variety of tools. Note however that the concept of
               <emphasis>informative</emphasis> means that the informative schemas
            are provided for utility and convenience reasons - not to perform the
            ultimate test on whether a document is valid or not. That latter task is
            reserved for the schema defined by the resource directory to be
            normative.</para>

      <title>Modules and namespaces</title>
      <section xml:id="modulesExample">
         <title>A more complex document</title>
         <para>Our first example Z39.86-AI document included almost nothing beyond
            the core Z39.86-2010 markup. Real information resources will require much
            more than this, of course, and Z39.86-AI profiles will provide a variety
            of markup constructs to represent those structures. Here is a slightly
            more complex Z39.86-AI document that demonstrates this:</para>
         <example>
            <title>A more complex Z39.86-AI document</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-more-complex-document'?></programlisting>
         </example>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="modulesSchemas">
         <title>Schemas and modules</title>
         <para>Earlier vocabularies such as <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/">XHTML 1.0</link> (used in
               <link
               xlink:href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/specifications/daisy_202.html"
               >DAISY 2.02</link>) and DTBook (used in <link
               xlink:href="http://www.niso.org/workrooms/daisy/Z39-86-2005.html"
               >ANSI/NISO Z39.86-2005</link>) were based on Document Type Definitions
            (DTDs).  Z39.86-2010 is based on a modularly-constructed schemas.
             Schemas can do more than DTDs: they are namespace aware, they allow the
            expression of intricate and complex content model constraints, and they
            support datatypes. All Z39.86-AI profiles define their markup using
            schemas in any combination of four different schema languages:  RelaxNG,
            NVDL, W3C XML Schema, and ISO Schematron.</para>
         <para>Schema languages naturally lend themselves to modular designs for
            markup languages. This means that there are multiple independent schema
            documents, each of which defines a set of elements and/or attributes that
            form a functional group.  These modules can then be combined (composed)
            into a single vocabulary through a master "driver" schema document that
            brings the individual modules together and defines their interrelations.
             This kind of architecture will be familiar to those accustomed to
            object-oriented software design.</para>
         <para>As noted above, every Z39.86-AI profile is based on the Z39.86-2010
            core markup language.  This means that every profile will use the
            Z39.86-2010 core modules in its master schema.  While there are a very
            few elements that must be included in every profile (e.g., the document
            element <code>document</code>), profiles are free to include other
            Z39.86-2010 modules that are appropriate to the kind of information
            resource the profile is designed to handle.  In the case of the book
            profile, the main Z39.86-2010 modules used include, among others, the
            ones defining basic text structures (headings, paragraphs, etc.), tables,
            notes, pagination, and internationalization attributes.</para>
         <para>Schema modules are designed to contain the markup definitions for
            targeted structures. In our sample document we see one such case: the
            table of contents: </para>
         <example>
            <title>Table of contents in example document</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-more-complex-document-toc'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para> The schema module for table of contents (<code>z3986-toc</code>)
            contains the definitions for the <code>toc</code>, <code>tocentry</code>,
               <code>label</code>, and <code>pageref</code> elements and their
            attributes. The book profile master schema then includes this module and
            defines that <code>toc</code> can occur within <code>frontmatter</code>.
            In this way the table of contents module is integrated within the book
            profile's markup model. Note also that the table of contents module
            itself draws upon constructs from other modules. In our example, the
               <code>toc</code> includes an element from a different Z38.86-2010
            module: the heading element <code>h</code>. The table of contents module
            brings this into the content model for <code>toc</code>. </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="modulesNamespaces">
         <title>Including other markup: namespaces</title>
         <para>So far, all the elements and attributes we have looked at are defined
            in schema modules that are part of the Z39.86-2010 specification, and
            hence are all in the default Z39.86-AI namespace. Just as the book
            profile brings in the table of contents module, so it can also bring in
            schema modules from other markup languages. In such a case, the elements
            and attributes from the other markup languages are distinguished by
            different namespaces.</para>
         <para> Our example document uses one attribute from a different namespace:
            the <code>translate</code> attribute defined by the <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/its/#trans-datacat"
               >Internationalization Tag Set (ITS)</link> of the W3C. This attribute
            is bound to the ITS namespace by the <code>its:</code> prefix, which
            itself is declared in the document's root element: </para>
         <example>
            <title>Declaration and use of the ITS namespace</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-more-complex-document-its'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para>There is no limitation to the number of different schema modules that
            can be combined in a profile, and there is no limitation to the number of
            namespaces from which these may draw. Schema modules can be taken from
            non-DAISY namespaces (<link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Math/"
               >MathML</link>, for example). When integrating different markup
            languages, the controlling principle should be to minimize duplication of
            effort.</para>

      <title>Adding semantic inflections</title>
      <section xml:id="semanticsExample">
         <title>A more meaningful example</title>
         <para>Let us look at an example which provides more detailed information
            about the front parts of the book:</para>
         <example>
            <title>A document with detailed frontmatter</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-document-with-role'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para> This document identifies the title page as a special structure, and
            provides even more detail within that, identifying an image that acts as
            a frontispiece, for example. </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="semanticsRoles">
         <title>The <code>role</code> attribute</title>
         <para> If the Z39.86-AI book profile were to try to provide a specialized
            element for every conceivable book structure, it would become too
            unwieldy to use. Instead, Z39.86-AI profiles, in addition to elements,
            can reference vocabularies of semantic <emphasis>roles</emphasis> that
            elements may play within the structure of the document. These roles are
            identified using the <code>role</code> attribute, which is available on
            every element in every Z39.86-AI profile. In our example, "title page" is
            one such role that is being played by a <code>section</code> element, and
            is identified by the <code>role</code> attribute value
               <code>"titlepage"</code>. The use of the <code>role</code> attribute
            in this manner thus allows for a finer-grained differentiation of
            structures within a manageable set of elements in the schema. </para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="semanticsVocabularies">
         <title>Role vocabularies</title>
         <para> For the <code>role</code> attribute to be at all useful, its values
            must be generally understood by authors and processing agents, which
            suggests standardization. To this end, profiles may define specific
               <emphasis>role vocabularies</emphasis> that extend their markup model
            to provide more detail about the semantics of the markup. Vocabularies
            are expressed using the Resource Description Framework (<link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</link>). RDF is the technology
            behind the "semantic web" and is a language for representing information
            about resources on the World Wide Web. In the Z39.86-AI Framework, <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</link> is used to define
            semantic properties, describe their meaning, and to relate them to other
            constructs. </para>
         <para> Role vocabularies defined by Z39.86 are typically expressed via <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa</link>, which uses
            special attributes to express <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/"
               >RDF</link> within the well-known structure of XHTML. Here, for
            example, is the definition of the "title page" role in the Z39.86-2010
            core vocabulary: <example>
               <title>RDFa representation of "title page" role</title>
               <programlisting xml:space="preserve"><xi:include href="./examples/TitlepageRDF.xml" parse="text" /></programlisting>
            </example></para>
         <para> The syntax above says that the element whose <code>id</code> is
               <code>titlepage</code> is also an <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</link> property. This means it
            can be used as a role value in a document and traced back to the
            definition given here. There is also a human-readable comment which says
            what the meaning of <code>titlepage</code> is.</para>
         <para> Each profile may define a default role vocabulary, which in that case
            is referenced in the profile's resource directory. However, Z39.86-AI
            documents are not limited to using the role vocabulary referenced by the
            resource directory, nor to use only vocabularies defined within the
            Z39.86-AI Framework. In our example document above, the <link
               xlink:href="http://dublincore.org/">Dublin Core</link> roles of
            "title" and "creator" are examples of non-Z39.86-AI roles. </para>

         <title>Using <code>role</code> in Z39.86-AI documents</title>
         <para>As stated previously, the <code>role</code> value
               <code>titlepage</code> is defined in the Z39.86-2010 core vocabulary.
            This example shows how to use this role value in a document to identify a
            section as a "title page".</para>

            <title>Section with titlepage role</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-document-with-role-extract'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para> Any element in a Z39.86-AI document can reference a role via the
               <code>role</code> attribute. The value of <code>role</code> is a
               <emphasis>CURIE</emphasis> (short for "Compact URI"), as defined in
               <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/">CURIE Syntax
            1.0</link>. Simply described, <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/">CURIEs</link> consist of a
            prefix and a local part that creates a unique identifier (URI) in a
            manner similar to the way that qualified names (QNames) are created using
               <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">XML
               namespaces</link>. In our example document, we find CURIEs such as
               <code>book:frontispiece</code>, where <code>book:</code> is the prefix
            and <code>frontispiece</code> is the local part. </para>
         <para>You have already noted that the role attribute value in the example
            above do not have a prefix (<code>role="titlepage"</code> for example).
            This is because a Z39.86-AI profile via its resource directory can define
            one vocabulary to be the default. Roles from the default vocabulary do
            not need prefixes.</para>
         <para>All <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/curie/">CURIEs</link>
            belonging to other vocabularies than the default one however, need to be
            prefixed, and the association between the prefix and a vocabulary URI
            must be declared in the document. In our example, the xmlns attribute is
            used to declare the association between the prefix <code>dc</code> and
            the URI <code>http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/</code> (which is an <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</link> vocabulary URI), and
            the same mechanism is used to associate the <code>book</code> prefix with
            the vocabulary URI corresponding to the Z39.86-AI Book vocabulary.</para>
         <remark role="todo">Note - prefix mapping mechanism is subject to change, as
            well as having the default prefix implied.</remark>

         <title>Custom role vocabularies</title>
         <para> The role-defining mechanism of the Z39.86-AI Framework is inherently
            extensible: the <code>role</code> attribute can reference any role
            vocabulary, not just the ones defined by the Z39.86-2010 specification or
            the various profiles and features. If a particular information resource
            or collection of resources require highly specialized semantic
            inflections, the document author can create a role vocabulary in <link
               xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa</link> that is
            tailored for that specific purpose. Conforming Z39.86-AI documents can
            then reference this custom vocabulary. Processing agents can discover the
               <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdfa-syntax/">RDFa</link>
            documents to find further information about the roles used and respond
            appropriately. </para>

         <title>Introduction to Z39.86-AI features</title>
         <para> The examples we have seen so far are relatively generic in their
            content. There are cases, however, where information resources may
            include areas highly specialized content. A typical example would be a
            math textbook, in which mathematical equations would occur within the
            context of the book structures. The book profile can handle this by
            including parts of <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Math/"
               >MathML</link> in its markup model. However, this markup will only be
            used in some books, probably relatively few compared to the total
            population of print books that could be expressed using the Z39.86-AI
            book profile. For this reason, the Z39.86-AI Framework has defined the
            concept of "features": discrete components similar in structure to
            profiles, but which are narrower in scope and which can be included by
            profiles and identified by documents as they need to use them. </para>

                     identifiable feature within the book profile, it gives Z39.86-AI
                     documents a mechanism for signaling their use or non-use of
                        <link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</link> to
                     processing agents. Processors that can handle a feature used in

         <title>An example using the MathML feature</title>
         <para> Here is an example document that includes a mathematical equation,

         <example>

         </example>
         <para> We saw earlier that profiles are identified by a <code>meta</code>
            element in the document <code>head</code>. Features are identified in a
            similar manner, by <code>meta</code> elements that are children of the
            profile's identifying <code>meta</code>. Feature <code>meta</code>s are
            noted by the <code>rel</code> attribute value of <code>"feature"</code>,
            again referencing the Z39.86-2010 Instance Metadata Vocabulary. The
               <code>resource</code> attribute is a URL maintained by the feature
            creator, and points to a resource directory, just as profile identifying
            URLs do. </para>
         <para> When a processing agent is presented with this document, it will

            this document. It can then respond to this in whatever way is
            appropriate. If it supports math, it may enable special math features,
            for example. Or, if it does not support math, the processor would be
            required to stop processing so as not to generate unreliable results.

         <para> Markup defined by Z39.86-AI features are intended to be optional
            parts of a profile: not all documents will take advantage of the
            specialized markup they provide, and not all processing systems will
            implement support for them. Nevertheless, all features that are included
            as part of a profile will be part of the normative schemas for the
            profile. </para>
         <para> In order to facilitate the authoring and use of documents that do not
            need the special functions provided by features, profiles may provide
            additional, informative schemas that simply remove one or more of the
            features from the normative schemas. The list of features used and the
            list of informative schemas will be found in the profile's resource
            directory. </para>

      <title>Metadata in Detail</title>
      <para>As described in <xref linkend="profilesMetadata" />, all Z39.86-AI
         documents must contain the metadata items <token>identifier</token>,
            <token>publisher</token>, and <token>date</token> (the latter also
         serving as a version identifier). This is an intentionally minimal set of
         metadata items, which serves only to uniquely identify the document and its
         publisher.</para>
      <para>In many circumstances, it is of course necessary to be able to express
         more and richer metadata about the document (and, in the case of
         republishing, about the document source, e.g. the work being republished).
         Given that various metadata expression languages exist in the world today,
         and given that different Z39.86-AI usage domains have different needs and
         requirements in terms of metadata, there is a certain amount of flexibility
         available with regards to how this "richer" metadata can be expressed in
         Z39.86-AI documents.</para>
      <section xml:id="metadataInDetailExternalResource">
         <title>Referencing metadata in external resources</title>
         <para>The key principle is that metadata resources can be external to the
            Z39.86-AI document itself. All we need to do in the Z39.86-AI document is
            to provide links to one or several such resources. </para>
         <para>Here is an example of a <link
               xlink:href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/mods/v3/">MODS</link> record
            being referenced from the <code>head</code> of a Z39.86-AI
            document:</para>
         <example>
            <title>Referencing an external metadata record: MODS</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-external-metadata-reference'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para>The link is labelled with information about the type (and, optionally,
            version) of the record.</para>
         <para>The referenced resource in its turn, is an XML document using the MODS
            grammar:</para>
         <example>
            <title>External metadata record: MODS</title>
            <programlisting><?example id='ai-primer-external-metadata-record-mods'?></programlisting>
         </example>
         <para>Z39.86-AI is extensible with regards to which types of metadata
            expression languages can be used in the referenced resources. Note how
            the <code>meta-record-type</code> meta element in the first example above
            contains the attribute <code>content="decl:mods"</code> &#8212; this is
            in fact a reference to the <link
               xlink:href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2010/vocab/decl/">Z39.86-2010 Instance Metadata Vocabulary</link>,
            which contains a listing of well known
            metadata expression languages. You can use any of the languages that are
            available in this listing. And, as metadata expression languages evolve,
            this listing will be expanded.</para>
         <para>The really ambitious metadata providers can also make use of the
            ability to reference several metadata records from the same document. As
            an example, a document could reference two MODS records, one of them MODS
            version 3.3 and the other version 4.0, and at the same time reference,
            say, an <link xlink:href="http://www.editeur.org">ONIX</link>-based
            record.</para>

         <title>Making the document itself the metadata resource</title>
         <para>As an alternative to the external metadata record approach as outlined
            above, it remains possible to provide a complete metadata record inside
            the Z39.86-AI document itself.</para>
         <para>When doing so, you must still provide the <code>meta-record</code> and
               <code>meta-record-type</code> meta items in the document
               <code>head</code> to clearly signal that in this instance, the
            document is its own metadata resource. (See the example below for how
            this is done.) </para>
         <para>Internal metadata expressions are done using <code>meta</code>
            elements in the document <code>head</code>, and/or using the <link

            that are available on most elements in the document <code>body</code>. By
            implication, you can only use metadata expression languages that are
            published as RDF in this way. </para>
         <para>The following example shows a document that provides <link
               xlink:href="http://dublincore.org/">DCMI</link> metadata using the

         </example>
         <para>Note how, in the <code>head</code>, the metadata resource is
            identified as ".", a single period. This is standard abbreviated way to
            refer to the current document URI. In other words, the single period is
            what says that this document is its own metadata resource.</para>

         directory and role vocabulary components of the framework, processing agents
