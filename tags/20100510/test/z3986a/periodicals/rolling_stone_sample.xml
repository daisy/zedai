<h>Come a Long Way</h>
<p>They used to talk about the tyrrany of distance - Australin as the arse-end of the world, the island culture forgot. Well, it's not like that anymore, and the abundance of art and music going on over the next few months is proof. Festival season is in full swing, starting with the best of our local acts at Homebake on December 6th and leading into all the action on New Year's eve, a Neil Young-headlined Big Day Out and the first Australian All Tomorrow's Parties festival, curated by Nick Cave. Plus artists like Henry Diltz and Storm Thorgerson will be exhibiting works in coming months too.</p>

<p>After divorcing her husband of two years, Carey Hart, Alecia Beth Moore (better known as Pink) travelled to Stockholm, Sweden, where she found the perfect environment to write her catchartic fifth album - ironically titled <em>Funhouse</em>. The outspoken singer talks about the emotionally draining process of writing the album, her political views (she was a Clinton supporter, but will vote for Obama), her dad, her first gig with Middle Ground (a band she fronted at 13), charitable artists and her favourite philosophy.</p>

<h>Editor's notes</h>
<p>It's not often that you get the chance to celebrate a milestone in the life of a magazine that is as much a part of the fabric of popular culture as ROLLING STONE - and it's even rarer that you get to celebrate it with the man who started it all. In this age of media buy-outs  and surprise mergers, ROLLING STONE founder Jann S. Wenner remains as personally involved with the magazine that he started as humanly possible, even after 40 years in the hot seat. He proved this by passing up the opportunity to interview Barack Obama in person so he could kick start a new phase for ROLLING STONE Australia at our star-studded revival party.</p>
<p>As anyone who saw Jann on <em>Enough Rope with Andrew Denton</em>, music channel Max or any of his numerous other TV appearances will confirm, Jann's enthusiasm for music and the magazine that unflinchingly covers it remains undiminished.</p>
<p>Along with some of Australia's best loved musicians and industry types, Jann helped usher in a new chapter in ROLLING STONE's Australian story. With a newly invigorated focus on local issues and talent, and a brand new web site on the horizon, ROLLING STONE is better placed than ever to help out the music world - for fans and artists alike.</p>
<p>I'd like to say a big thanks to Jann for gracing us with his presence, and everyone who performed, filmed and generally helped on the night, and to the talented team who put together ROLLING STONE Australia each month.</p>

<h>Deleted Scenes</h>
<p>It was great to see Rolling Stone founder Jann Wenner interviewed on <em>Enough Rope</em>. I can't think of a better pairing, Denton (who in my opinion is one of our contry's best interviewers) interviewing one of America's finest journalists. Their lively banter was engaging and essential viewing but I thought it could have gone for longer. Any ideas on how I might get my hands on the unedited version? C'mon Auntie! Put together a Jann Wenner Redux for us hardcore fans. You could show it on ABC2!</p>

<h>Taking it Easy</h>
<p>Congratulations on your latest cover! (RS684). The Easybeats is one of Australia's most important (and underrated) bands. I'm glad you're educating the youngsters that think Sneaky Sound System or the Presets are the only Australian bands worth listening to. By the way, I thought the Living End did a fantastic job covering "Guitar Band" on the tribute album.</p>

<h>Blasphemer</h>
<p>According to all Australian magazines, every time AC/DC releases a new album it is a masterpiece. They hav ebeen recording the same dull album over an dover again! I think Airbourne's debut is better than anything AC/DC has done in years.</p>

<h>Oasis vs. Even</h>
<p>Why do you persist in printing articles on Oasis? ("Still Fixin' for a Fight", RS 684). They haven't released a decent tune since 1995! Readers looking for killer tunes with a retro influence should check out the new album from Even. Been out six months and you bastards still haven't reviewed it!</p>

<h>We Know Where You Are</h>
<p>I was shocked when I read the "Under My Skin" article (RS684). I'm still having nightmares about someone implanting a chip in me and being able to follow my every move. I find the idea of people being monitored way scary, and whether it is a chip in my arm or a bug in my mobile phone, I think it is the worst thing imaginable.</p>
