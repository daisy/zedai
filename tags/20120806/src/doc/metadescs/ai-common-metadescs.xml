        <para role="desc-sub">Unless an {annotation} element has a {[[#z3998.role.attrib]]} value of {temporary},

            referenced by at least one {[[#z3998.annoref]]}. For annotations that apply to more than one element,

                    CITATION
    -->

    <section about="z3998.citation">
        <para role="desc-main">The {citation} element represents an author's acknowledgment of the
            original author and/or work of a directly or indirectly borrowed idea, quote or other
            resource. Citations typically occur in conjunction with epigraphs, quotes,
            illustrations, charts and diagrams.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The optional {[[#z3998.ref.attrib]]} attribute on the {citation} element
            is used to establish an explicit association between the {citation} and the passage or resource
            it references; the placement of the {citation} does not, by default, imply an association with any 
            element in the document. Some elements do provide a mechanism for implied relationships, however
            (see the {[[#z3998.quote.block quote]]} element, for example). When adding citations, refer to the 
            documentation for the element the citation is being attached to for more information.
        </para>
        <para role="desc-sub">A {citation} can also be linked to the work it cites by including a
            child {[[#z3998.ref]]} element. A {[[#z3998.ref.attrib]]} attribute can be attached to the
            nested {ref} element to reference a work in the current document's
            {[[#z3998.bibliography]]}, for example. To reference other resources, including resources external to
            the current document, the {[[#xlink.href.attrib]]} attribute must be used
            instead.</para>

    <section about="z3998.code">
        <para role="desc-main"> The {code} element is intended for general instances of code as found in
            works of fiction and similar non-technical documents, which includes computer
            programming code, commands and command input/output as well as representations of
            numeric and text coding systems, such as Morse code. </para>
        <para role="desc-sub"> For computer programming books, manuals and specifications, specializing
            the {code} element or using a computer markup feature is recommended. </para>

                    CUSTOM-CONTENT
    -->

    <section about="z3998.custom-content">
        <para role="desc-sub"> The republishing of documents often requires the insertion of content
            that was not a part of the original source document. For example, in the case of
            indexes, bibliographies and other ordered sections, this requirement may take the form
            of placeholder sections to mark gaps in the alphabetic list of entries. To indicate that
            an element presents content that is a deviation from the source, the
            {[[#z3998.role.attrib]]} attribute can be used with the value {custom}. No behaviors are
            defined for how a processing agent should handle sections so identified, however.

        <para role="desc-sub">The {description} element can either contain the text content of the description or reference an external file in which it can be found via the {[[#xlink.href.attrib]]} attribute. It is not permitted to mix both methods, however.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">To ensure the description can be rendered, the {description} element must not include descendant elements and attributes that require a description.</para>

        <para role="desc-sub">
            The number or glyph that appears before the {item} is typically controlled by the attributes specified
            on the parent {[[#z3998.list list]]} element together with the number of preceding {item}s.
            The Content Rendition feature's

            unordered nature of the list.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub"> By default, an unordered list is prefixed by bullets and an ordered list
            by numeric values. To change this behavior, refer to the Content Rendition feature's

        <para role="desc-sub">Notes provide or reference sources of additional information, or acknowledge the source of a quotation or idea. In printed matter, they are usually distinguishable from annotations by their location either at the bottom of print pages, at the end of sections or in the back matter of a document.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">Each {note} is typically referenced by a {[[#z3998.noteref]]} or prefixed by a page location (when explicit references have been omitted from the text). If the {note} does not have a referent in a Z39.98-AI document, it must include a {[[#z3998.ref.attrib]]} attribute that references back to the nearest element in the document to the content to which it applies.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The {[[#z3998.role.attrib]]} attribute optionally expresses the semantic nature of the note. The value can be either {footnote} or {endnote}. If omitted, the implicit value {footnote} is assumed.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">When a note is prefixed by a number or symbol, that identifier should be included using the Content Rendition feature's {[[http://www.daisy.org/z3998/2012/auth/features/rend/current/#z3998.rend.prefix.attrib prefix]]} attribute.</para>

            content, but its media type must be supported by the current profile and features in

            types.</para>
