          <ln>NO MORE GRIEF.</ln>
          <ln>A month left, let's get our lowest road toll</ln>
        </h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">MAL HYDE, POLICE COMMISSIONER</byline>
        <p>ALL South Australians should be delighted with the reduction in road trauma so far this
          year.</p>
        <p>Our road toll stands at 88, compared with 112 at this time last year. However, last
          December we lost 14 people in road crashes, so the job is far from over.</p>
        <p>At the end of last year, South Australia Police and The Advertiser recognised the need to
          drastically reduce our road toll and launched the Countdown 100 campaign in February.</p>
        <p>Despite the encouraging results so far, we know things can change quite quickly.</p>
        <p>There is, however, cause for cautious optimism. Recent figures show death and serious
          injury on our roads has decreased.</p>
        <p>This demonstrates that trauma is not the inevitable price we have to pay for using
          motorised transport.</p>
        <p>Indeed, understanding that road safety is a fundamental responsibility of all road users
          is the key and, fortunately, most of us recognise that.</p>
        <p>The reduction in casualties on our roads could have been even greater had some drivers
          not chosen to take outrageous risks. Road trauma is the consequence of ignoring road
          safety.</p>
        <p>Too often serious collisions have been caused by people taking stupid risks on our roads,
          resulting in death or injury to themselves or others, leaving a trail of destruction and
          devastation.</p>
        <p>A closer look often reveals these drivers are persistent or repeat offenders who
          regularly put the lives of other road users at risk, because they think they can or just
          don't care.</p>
        <p>But we're here to tell them their behaviour will not be tolerated.</p>
        <p>Habitual, reckless road users are potential killers.</p>
        <p>So the message is clear - they are not misguided, they are not people letting off steam,
          they are criminals - idiots disregarding the road rules and behaving in a way that
          potentially results in tragic consequences for innocent people. There should be no
          hesitation in calling them <quote>criminals</quote> . </p>
        <p>These road users are in a class of their own and we should not accept their
          stupidity.</p>
        <p>I have said before we should all refuse to tolerate dangerous, reckless, careless or
          negligent behaviour on our roads, and there are ways responsible road users can do
          that.</p>
        <p>If you see someone behaving dangerously or recklessly on the road, telephone the police
          Traffic Watch hotline. We will gladly follow up on any information provided to us.</p>
        <p>If you are unfortunate enough to be travelling with someone who is driving too fast,
          under the influence of alcohol or drugs or driving in some other dangerous manner, you
          really need to make a choice. Make a decision not to travel with them and get out of the
          car or you can tell them to stop driving that way. These are choices that could save your
          life.</p>
        <p>We need a whole-of-community approach to change attitudes. This means everyone must
          accept responsibility for road safety and the penalties for dangerous road use must
          reflect the community's expectations and intolerance of the risks these people create.</p>
        <p>Let's eliminate the threat to our safety. These stupid, idiotic drivers must be seen for
          what they really are - criminals whose disregard for the rest of us must not be
          tolerated.</p>
        <p>Death or serious injury on South Australian roads is not inevitable.</p>

         <quote xml:id="ID0ELQ1">While the (road toll) figure is well down on last year, too many
            South Australians are still losing their lives on our roads. We're doing far better than
            we have seen in the past, such as the shockingly high peak of 382 fatalities in 1974,
            but everyone needs to be committed to doing so much better.

        </h>
        <p>PUBLIC sympathy for fallen football star Ben Cousins, who missed out on the weekend's AFL
          draft, is quickly evaporating.</p>
        <p>AdelaideNow readers yesterday applauded the decision by the competition's 16 clubs not to
          draft Cousins, who had been cleared to play again in 2009 provided he abided by strict
          conditions.</p>
        <p> Jack, of Adelaide, said it was <quote>no surprise</quote> the recovering drug and alcohol
          addict had been overlooked. <quote>Let his self-inflicted, destructive downfall serve as a
            lesson to other players,</quote> he said. <quote>Your fame is fleeting and if you take the
            foolish path in thinking that you're bullet proof then this is what you end up
            with.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Tony said it was important to remember that while Cousins had never tested positive for
          illicit drugs, he had admitted taking them</p>
        <p> Melvin said the AFL clubs should be given credit <quote>for recognising that Cousins is
            still a sick man</quote> . </p>

        <p>CALVARY North Adelaide Hospital is the first private hospital in Australia to house a new
          $1.5 million CT scanner.</p>
        <p>The machine, owned by Radiology SA, will ease some of the demand on a similar scanner at
          the Royal Adelaide Hospital.</p>
        <p>The Siemens 128-slice CT scanner provides faster and more accurate images, shown above
          with radiographer Sharon Dunstan, to help diagnose a range of diseases, including cancer
          and heart disease.</p>
        <p> Radiology SA managing partner Dr Susie Saloniklis said the machine was <quote>an exciting
            development</quote> for patients and the medical profession, giving more accurate
          results. </p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">LAUREN NOVAK, EDUCATION REPORTER</byline>
        <p>A GROWING number of students are completing the Premier's Reading Challenge, including
          15,000 who have been taking part since it began five years ago.</p>
        <p>This year, more than 106,000 students from 752 schools took up the Challenge - 5 per cent
          more than last year.</p>
        <p>The number of indigenous entrants rose 10 per cent to 2513.</p>
        <p>The Premier's Reading Challenge began in 2004 and encourages students from Reception to
          Year 9 to read a minimum of 12 books in a year.</p>
        <p> More than 15,000 <quote>champion</quote> medals were this year awarded to students who
          have taken part every year since its inception. </p>
        <p> A further 25,500 children joined in for the first time this year. Education Minister
          Jane Lomax-Smith said the results were <quote>proof that South Australian students,
            teachers and families are continuing to embrace the challenge to read more books - and
            they are succeeding</quote> . </p>
        <p>To continue attracting more students to the program the State Government has recruited
          the Adelaide United soccer team as ambassadors.</p>
        <p>Coach Aurelio Vidmar is already an ambassador for the Challenge.</p>
        <p>Reds striker Cristiano said he liked encouraging the students to read.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Reading is very important to the life of every child because you can't do so many
            things without reading,</quote> he said. While his favourite book was the Bible,
          Cristiano also unsurprisingly enjoyed reading about sports. </p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">ANTHONY KEANE, MONEY EDITOR</byline>
        <p>PLUNGING share markets have wiped 20 per cent off the value of most Australians'
          retirement savings in the past year.</p>
        <p>After another horror month on the markets in November, superannuation fund balances have
          suffered the worst 12-month period in history.</p>
        <p>Preliminary estimates by independent research group SuperRatings show a negative 20 per
          cent investment return for the median balanced super option for the year to the end of
          November.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>The last 12 months have been unprecedented in the superannuation arena. Australians
            just haven't been exposed to this sort of market turmoil ever
          before,</quote> SuperRatings managing director Jeff Bresnahan said. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>We know with confidence that there has never been a 12-month result like
            this,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>Four out of five of Australians hold their superannuation in the balanced option, which
          typically holds about 30 per cent in Australian shares, 20 per cent international shares,
          10 per cent property, 30 per cent fixed interest and 10 per cent cash, although this can
          vary widely from fund to fund.</p>
        <p>Many of the people not in a balanced fund have a bigger proportion invested in shares
          and, as a result, have suffered heavier losses.</p>
        <p>At its low in November, Australia's share market was 53 per cent below its record high
          set just over a year ago, as the global financial crisis transformed into an economic
          crisis that is pushing many countries into</p>
        <p>recession. The November superannuation performance would have been twice as bad if not
          for last week's rebound in shares.</p>
        <p>Financial Planning Association SA chapter chair Kerrin Falconer said despite last week's
          bounce, the weakness was likely to continue.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We seem to have one step forward, two steps back,</quote> she said. While the
          superannuation slump has spooked many people, financial planners say for most people now
          is not the time to switch from a balanced option to the safety of cash. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>If you do, you will crystallise capital losses and you won't have the opportunity
            of picking up some of the large gains early when the market rallies,</quote> Ms Falconer
            said. <quote>Often the best days come after a substantial sell-off and if you are out of
            the market you will miss those days.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">More killer drivers behind bars longer</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">SEAN FEWSTER, COURT REPORTER</byline>
        <p>JAIL terms for killer drivers are at an eight-year high, with offenders spending an
          average of four years behind bars.</p>
        <p>This is a stunning turnaround for the controversial offence, which a year ago had drivers
          serving 31 months in jail.</p>
        <p>Roger McEwen, whose daughter Sonia was killed in a 2001 crash, yesterday welcomed the
          rise.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It's about bloody time, and I bet that will be everyone's reaction,</quote> he
            said. <quote>I think judges are finally beginning to learn and to follow the community's
            opinion.</quote> 
        </p>
         <quote>I'm very, very glad to hear this.</quote> 
        <p>State Government data, obtained exclusively by The Advertiser , shows the average jail
          term for causing death by dangerous driving rose from 31.5 months for the seven cases in
          2005 to 48 months from the 13 cases in 2006.</p>
        <p>The 2006 figure - the most recent available - is the highest since 2004, when the average
          sentence was 43.8 months, and outstrips the record of 44 months in 1999. The length of
          suspended sentences also rose, from 18 months in 2005 to 23 1/2 months.</p>
        <p>Six offenders received suspended sentences in 2006 while two were jailed, compared with
          four jailed and two suspensions in 2005.</p>
        <p> Mr McEwen's daughter was killed by dangerous driver Christopher Ian Clothier in a crash
          at St Marys in June, 2001. Clothier served 10 months' jail for the crime. <quote>That's not
            long enough for taking someone's life,</quote> Mr McEwen said. <quote>He was
            irresponsible, he shouldn't have been going that fast.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> He said Christmas remained a difficult time for him and his wife Chris. <quote>It's been
            eight years and, no matter how hard you try, Christmas is always hard,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p> Attorney-General Michael Atkinson expected the upward trend to continue because of
            the <quote>new charge of aggravated-cause death by dangerous driving</quote> recently
          added to the legislation. <quote>This sends a strong message to reckless drivers that if
            your actions cause the death of another person you face years behind bars,</quote> he
          said. </p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">JILL PENGELLEY</byline>
        <p>A BLANKET covering a body at the side of the road was Alan Fraser's last glimpse of his
          wife of 41 years.</p>
        <p>In October last year, the retired electrician, from Ingle Farm, was the only survivor of
          a crash that killed three people, east of Waikerie.</p>
        <p>His sedan was struck by an out-of-control Nissan Pulsar travelling in the opposite
          direction.</p>
        <p>The impact killed the 17-year-old driver of the Nissan and his male passenger, 15.</p>
        <p>Mr Fraser said Euphemia, 62, who everyone called Fame, was groaning in the seat beside
          him before falling silent.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>As they helped me to the ambulance, I made a point of turning around and I saw the
            blanket,</quote> he recalled yesterday. </p>
        <p>Mr Fraser has recovered from his multiple broken bones but said the loss was still
          acute.</p>
        <p> He described rolling over in bed one night recently and finding a pillow he had pushed
          to one side. <quote>In a half-sleep condition, I thought it was Fame and it
          wasn't,</quote> he said. <quote>That's so hard after all these years.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>He will turn 65 on Thursday and has scrapped all his plans for retirement and travel with
          his wife. The couple's two sons and their families are also struggling to deal with the
          tragedy.</p>
        <p>Mr Fraser blamed inattention and inexperience for the accident, with the driver of the
          Nissan over-correcting to regain control of his car.</p>
        <p>He appealed for the driving age to be raised and for mandatory defensive driving
          courses.</p>
        <p> He also questioned whether teenagers should be allowed to drive at high speeds on
          country roads. <quote>It's just like a toy to some of them and it's not - it's a serious
            weapon,</quote> he said. </p>

        <h property="dc:title">No to zinc merger ray of hope for 3000 jobs</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">MICHAEL OWEN, POLITICAL REPORTER</byline>
        <p>WORKERS at a Port Pirie smelter are expected to get a reprieve today when the world's
          largest zinc producer decides against merging its Australian operations.</p>
        <p>The Advertiser understands the board of Belgium-owned Nyrstar will meet at its London
          base today to vote against a merger between the company's Port Pirie plant and its
          Tasmanian smelter.</p>
        <p>Industry sources said the decision was made after a three-month review of Nyrstar's
          zinc-smelting operations and will keep South Australian jobs safe in the short-term.</p>
        <p>This comes as Premier Mike Rann prepares to fly to Europe this week for a brief
          multi-city trade mission, which will include talks with Nyrstar about its long-term future
          in SA.</p>
        <p>Fears remain for the security of thousands of jobs after the company said the Federal
          Government's proposed carbon pollution reduction scheme would force the closures of both
          its Port Pirie and Hobart smelters.</p>
        <p>This would lead to the loss of more than 3000 jobs and more than $2 billion a year in
          export revenue.</p>
        <p>Southern Flinders Ranges Development Board executive manager Mark Malcolm said more than
          30 per cent of Port Pirie's working population - at least 2000 people - would be
          unemployed if the smelter closed.</p>
        <p>Mr Rann said he would, this week, meet Nyrstar chief executive Paul Fowler and chief
          operating officer Greg McMillan in London. He met Nyrstar's management in Adelaide in
          August and wrote to Prime Minister Kevin Rudd about the impact of the proposed emissions
          trading scheme.</p>
        <p>The Premier's office declined to reveal other details about his European mission, other
          than to say it included several cities and would be for just a few days.</p>
        <p> Opposition Leader Martin Hamilton-Smith, who last week visited Port Pirie for talks on
          the future of the Nyrstar smelter, will today take to his shadow cabinet a proposal to
          present to the Federal Government for Nyrstar to be exempt from Labor's
            planned <quote>carbon tax</quote> . </p>
        <p>Labor's emissions trading scheme has been out for consultation since July 1 and will be
          finalised in a white paper to be released on December 15.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>If that does not fix the bureaucratic anomaly that has Nyrstar not being eligible
            for an exemption from the tax, then the plant will simply become economically
            unviable,</quote> Mr Hamilton-Smith said yesterday. </p>

          in Mumbai's bloody horror</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">PAUL PEACHEY, SANDRA O'MALLEY</byline>
        <p>WRACKED by more than three days of bloodshed, the Indian financial capital of Mumbai
          began mourning its dead yesterday, as authorities revealed the terrorists' chilling
          mission to slaughter 5000 people.</p>
        <p>A day after the siege ended, corpses were still being brought out of the luxury Taj Mahal
          Hotel where three suspected Muslim militants made a last stand before Indian commandos
          killed them in a blaze of gunfire and explosions.</p>
        <p>At least 174 people were killed in the rampage by the gunmen at 10 sites across south
          Mumbai, starting late on Wednesday night. One site, the Leopold Cafe, a popular tourist
          restaurant and scene of one of the first attacks, reopened yesterday.</p>
        <p>The death toll was revised down yesterday from 195 after authorities said some bodies
          were counted twice, but they said it could rise again as areas of the Taj Mahal Hotel were
          still being searched.</p>
        <p>Among the dead were 18 foreigners, including two Australians and six Americans. Nine
          attackers were killed. Four Australians were among the nearly 300 people wounded.</p>
        <p>Authorities had confirmed the safety of 84 Australians who were in the vicinity of the
          areas directly affected by the attacks.</p>
        <p>But the Government still would not discount the possibility more Australians may have
          been caught up in the violence.</p>
        <p>There had been serious concerns for an Australian who was a registered guest at the Taj
          Mahal Hotel. But the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade yesterday confirmed contact
          had been made with the person, who was a registered guest at the hotel on November 25 and
          had left Mumbai before the attacks began last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Another Australian, NSW winery export manager Garrick Harvison - who was holed up in his
          room at the Oberoi Hotel for more than 40 hours - was thrilled to be reunited with family
          in Sydney on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I'm ecstatic . . . all I could think about was my family and just getting home and
            just to be on Aussie soil really,</quote> Mr Harvison said. </p>
        <p>A previously unknown Muslim group called Deccan Mujahideen - a name suggesting origins
          inside southern India - has claimed responsibility, but Indian officials said the sole
          surviving gunman was from Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Pakistan denied it was involved. The assaults have raised fears among U.S. officials
          about a possible surge in violence between Pakistan and India - the nuclear-armed rivals
          have fought three wars against each other.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">FRANCES STEWART</byline>
        <p>JUNIOR numbers at surf life saving clubs across the state have trebled in some cases
          during the past year, but thousands more are wanted.</p>
        <p> North Haven Surf Life Saving Club has grown from 30 <quote>Nippers</quote> last year to
          more than 90 for the 2008-09 season. </p>
        <p> Surf Life Saving SA general manager Elaine Farmer, who is also a member at North Haven,
          said the rise in Nipper numbers at the club, one of the smallest in Adelaide, was <quote>an
            extraordinary result</quote> . </p>
        <p>
           <quote>But from what we understand we are not the only club experiencing this increase in
            numbers,</quote> she said. <quote>Across the state we have thousands of Nippers and we'd
            like to see thousands more.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Ms Farmer said Nippers, who are junior members aged between five and 13, was a great way
          for children to have fun, make friends and learn skills that could save their lives.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>The Nippers program on Saturday afternoons is a great way to teach kids about water
            safety and life skills,</quote> she said. <quote>And the best thing is that the whole
            family can get involved.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>North Haven Nippers Jack, 9, and Harry Anderson, 13, both enjoy learning new lifesaving
          skills.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I like learning how to ride waves and how to ride boards and training for surf
            lifesaving,</quote> Jack said. </p>
        <p>Although the season has already started, new arrivals are welcome to the program at any
          time.</p>

            discredited</quote> they increase the risk of drowning, a peak water safety body warns. </p>
        <p> The Royal Life Saving Society has so many <quote>serious safety concerns</quote> with what
          it says is a <quote>dumbed-down</quote> revamp of the program, it has formally withdrawn its
          support and accreditation for 2009. </p>
        <p>Concerns have been raised with Recreation and Sport Minister Michael Wright.</p>
        <p> In a presentation last week to the society's annual general meeting, a copy of which has
          been obtained by The Advertiser, deputy chairman Kevin Burrowes said an analysis of the
          new program found it was <quote>potentially dangerous</quote> because it <quote>omits many
            key water-safety and survival skills</quote> . </p>
        <p>Vacswim runs from January 5 to 13 at about 155 locations, involving up to 20,000 children
          aged over 5. The society's analysis found:</p>
        <p>UNNECESSARY activities where there is a real risk of hyperventilation and
          asphyxiation.</p>
        <p>DEEP-WATER skills in early levels with no requirement to teach sculling or treading water
          techniques.</p>
        <p>NO training with personal flotation devices.</p>
        <p>TASKS of such short duration that they lose educational value.</p>
        <p>PERSONAL survival and rescue skills dropped as requirements to advance to the next
          level.</p>
        <p>Mr Burrowes said the society's Swim and Survive program had been removed from Vacswim
          without any consultation.</p>
        <p>The new program was developed by LeisureCo in conjunction with UniSA and evaluated by
          water safety expert Ken Richter.</p>
        <p>Ian Buckley, managing director of Adelaide-based LeisureCo, could not be reached for
          comment yesterday.</p>
        <p> Mr Burrowes warned: <quote>There is a very real risk that an emphasis on participant
            numbers and possible complacency could result in the program degenerating into . . . a
            child-minding program.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Opposition recreation and sport spokesman Terry Stephens said parents should be made
          aware of the program's potential dangers.</p>
        <p> Mr Wright was overseas yesterday and unavailable for comment, but Acting Minister Paul
          Holloway said the Government <quote>is obliged to review and update its water safety
            programs</quote> . </p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">FRANCES STEWART</byline>
        <p>NINE out of 10 people who drown at the beach are men, a National Coastal Safety report
          shows.</p>
        <p>The report by Surf Life Saving Australia revealed 88 people - including 11 South
          Australians - drowned along the Australian coast in 2007-08. This is 7 per cent greater
          than the previous season and higher than the five-year average.</p>
        <p>A disturbing trend revealed by the report was that men accounted for 89 per cent of
          drowning deaths in coastal areas.</p>
        <p>Last summer, the number of men who drowned on Australian beaches increased from 69 to 78.
          Ten of the season's 88 fatalities were women.</p>
        <p>For the first time in recent years the report found younger men were most at risk.</p>
        <p>Australian Surf Lifesaver of the Year and Southport Surf Life Saving Club volunteer
          Andrew Bedford said the higher number of male drownings could be attributed to men taking
          more risks in the surf.</p>
        <p>The 20-29 age bracket was the most likely to drown at the beach - accounting for almost
          one-quarter of deaths.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">TONY REED</byline>
        <p>A MULTI-MILLION dollar equine precinct and 3500-home residential development at Murray
          Bridge is set to become a major hub for thoroughbred racing in SA.</p>
        <p>Murray Bridge Racing Club has released plans to buy 800ha of farming land next to the
          South-Eastern Freeway to build a new racetrack and training complex as well as creating a
          350ha residential area with a retail and community centre. This is equal to an area 15
          times the size of Cheltenham racecourse</p>
        <p>More than 30 per cent of the total site will be dedicated to open space.</p>
        <p>The development still has to gain State Government approval. However, it is envisaged
          that within three to four years a new state-of-the-art racecourse with grass and synthetic
          tracks, along with at least 50ha of horse-training facilities will be completed.</p>
        <p>Murray Bridge Racing Club chairman Reg Nolan said once the new racecourse was
          operational, the present track adjoining the golf course also would be redeveloped.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>In the longer term, the plan will see the development of 3500 houses as part of a
            quality residential development,</quote> he said. </p>
         <quote>It really has the potential to become the jewel in the crown for racing in
          SA.</quote> 
        <p>Thoroughbred Racing SA will act as guarantor for a $5 million loan after the provincial
          club signed an agreement with the state's controlling body last week.</p>
        <p>The agreement was to buy the land in February offering the existing racecourse and
          farmland as security. The planned equine precinct will feature new and fully resourced
          race and training tracks, multi-purpose function and spectator facilities, as well as a
          specialised estate for trainers and their horses.</p>
        <p> Environmental features for the scheme include on-site water storage, wetland and water
          recycling. TRSA chairman Philip Bentley said: <quote>We anticipate that Murray Bridge
            eventually will be the largest thoroughbred training centre in the state.</quote>

        <p>GRAND PLAN</p>
        <p>Purchase 800ha of farming land adjacent the South-Eastern Freeway, on the outskits of
          Murray Bridge, to build a new racetrack and training complex.</p>

        <p>30 per cent to be dedicated to open space.</p>
        <p>Development is the equivalent in size to the area of 15 Cheltenham racecourse sites.</p>

        <p>AUSTRALIA'S premier trade promotion event in the U.S. will be expanded to San Francisco
          next year, building on its success in Los Angeles and New York.</p>
        <p>G'day USA also will receive a boost from the Baz Luhrmann blockbuster Australia which
          will be screened at a gala event in New York during the week-long program in January.</p>
        <p>Australian Consul-General in New York and former state premier John Olsen said San
          Francisco was chosen partly because it was home to the information technology hub Silicon
          Valley.</p>
        <p>TAFE student Gemma Stocks, 21, of North Adelaide, is attending next year's G'Day USA
          event after winning the 2008 South Australian Fashion Student of the Year award.</p>
        <p>Ms Stocks will showcase her knitwear made specifically for cyclists from South Australian
          Michell wool.</p>
        <p>Plans to export her cycling knitwear to the U.S. by 2012 could be fast-tracked thanks to
          contacts made through G'Day USA.</p>

          helps man in fall</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">MICHAEL MILNES, POLICE REPORTER</byline>
        <p>A BUSHWALKING surgeon has helped a man who fell from a cliff in a national park south of
          Adelaide.</p>
        <p>The Woodcroft man, aged in his 20s, was climbing a 30m cliff in the Onkaparinga River
          National Park at about 8am yesterday when he fell about 15m into the river, hitting a
          rock.</p>
        <p> The injured man then <quote>dog-paddled</quote> to the shore where one of his friends
          dragged him out, while another went for help. </p>
        <p>As one of them was looking for help, he came across a surgeon who was bushwalking nearby.
          The surgeon called paramedics before making his way to help the injured man.</p>
        <p>It took the first ambulance crew on the scene 40 minutes to reach the man, walking
          through rugged terrain and descending nearly 300m to the bottom of the gorge.</p>
        <p>As they were making their way to the scene, a rescue paramedic was lowered to the scene
          from the Adelaide Bank rescue helicopter. Paramedics said the man was conscious and talked
          to them throughout his ordeal.</p>
        <p>He was stabilised by paramedics and as the rescue helicopter hovered above the the cliff
          from which the man fell, he and a paramedic were winched to safety.</p>
        <p>He was flown to the spinal unit at the Royal Adelaide Hospital with suspected spinal and
          leg injuries.</p>
        <p> Intensive care paramedic Kirsty Shearer said <quote>it was definitely a stroke of
            luck</quote> that his friend found the surgeon in the park. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>That certainly assisted crews when they arrived on the scene to have that
            information at hand and to have that assistance on scene,</quote> she said. <quote>That
            was fantastic.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> When The Advertiser spoke to the surgeon, who wished to remain anonymous, he modestly
            said, <quote>all I did was make a phone call</quote> . </p>
        <p>The surgeon and the injured man's friends, along with a STAR Group officer from the
          helicopter, walked to waiting ambulance and Country Fire Service crews.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">JOANNA VAUGHAN, POLITICAL REPORTER</byline>
        <p>ENHANCED DNA and finger-printing technology capable of recovering evidence burnt in a
          major fire will be used for the first time this summer in the hunt for firebugs.</p>
        <p>The anti-arson unit, Operation Nomad, will have hi-tech equipment and more up-to-date
          intelligence than ever before as the state braces itself for one of the worst bushfire
          seasons for years. Emergency service vehicles also will be armed with intelligence data to
          help track known culprits.</p>
        <p>Police have already arrested 11 people for deliberately lighting fires - only 15 days
          into the fire-danger season. At least two of those apprehended knew they were being
          monitored by police at the time.</p>
        <p>Four have been charged under new laws that could see them sent to prison for up to 20
          years.</p>
        <p>Detective Senior Sergeant Lloyd Sanderson, who heads Operation Nomad, said police were
          now better equipped to catch firebugs.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>This year we have more eyes and ears out there,</quote> he said. <quote>We are giving
            them (police officers) more accurate and up-to-date intelligence packages to support
            their activities. We have enhanced DNA and finger-print technologies that can recover
            DNA even if they are burnt. We have also extended the intelligence sweep to all of the
            emergency services, so all fire trucks and all SES vehicles will carry the suspect
            information forms.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Police will also closely monitor 44 known arsonists or firebugs through random door
          knocks, spot checks and surveillance.</p>
        <p>On days of extreme fire danger, police officers will visit each one to determine their
          whereabouts. Up to 100 police patrols will be available to roam areas frequently hit by
          arsonists on danger days.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>These are people who put whole communities at risk and they are responsible for
            loss of lives, loss of livestock and loss of income,</quote> he said. <quote>This is a
            reprehensible crime. We will be hard in the faces of these people.</quote>

        <p>ALEC Roberts is keeping his feet on the ground after winning a prized place at the
          Australian Ballet School in Melbourne.</p>
        <p>The gifted 16-year-old from Colonel Light Gardens is one of six young dancers across the
          country preparing to join the school next year. He is the only South Australian accepted
          into the full-time course and will undertake a four-year training program.</p>
        <p>It places him in an elite group of aspiring dancers destined for a career in ballet.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I guess you could say my career has taken a major leap forward,</quote> he said
          yesterday. </p>
         <quote>But it also means a lot of work, not only towards my dance, but washing cars and
          dishes to help pay my way for the next four years.</quote> 
        <p> ABS head of training Mark Annear said Roberts performed well in auditions and
            had <quote>good, natural ability</quote> . </p>
        <p>Before he leaves for Melbourne, Roberts will compete in the Royal Academy of Dance
          Overseas Scholarship in Sydney on December 9.</p>
        <p>Roberts will dance the lead role in the Elayne Cherry Dance Centre production of The
          Nutcracker</p>
        <p>at Her Majesty's Theatre, at 6pm,</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">LAURA ANDERSON, POLITICAL REPORTER, CANBERRA</byline>
        <p>THE nation's federal MPs today will receive an early Christmas present - free grog,
          hand-delivered to their Parliament House office.</p>
        <p>But the gift will come with a catch as it is the latest ploy by the alcohol industry to
          force the Government to ditch its excise rise on alcopops.</p>
        <p>The alcoholic products to be delivered to MPs look and taste like alcopops, but have been
          manufactured carefully to avoid federal excise.</p>
        <p>Up to 10 new products have been launched since the Federal Government announced its 70
          per cent excise rise on alcopops in April. They include:</p>
        <p> FRUIT flavoured and sparkling <quote>wine-pops</quote> ; </p>
        <p>HIGH-STRENGTH beer;</p>
        <p> BEER-BASED <quote>malternatives</quote> , and; </p>
        <p>CIDER products.</p>
        <p>The Distilled Spirits Industry Council of Australia estimates the gifts have cost
          thousands of dollars to purchase.</p>
        <p>But council spokesman Stephen Riden said the alcohol buy-up was worthwhile to bring
          attention to the issue of inconsistency in Australia's alcohol tax system.</p>
        <p>The council is calling for volumetric taxation - taxing drinks purely on their alcoholic
          content.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Childcare centre to close by Christmas</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">BRENTON EDWARDS</byline>
        <p>ADELAIDE'S childcare crisis is set to worsen with the impending closure of a western
          suburbs centre a week before Christmas.</p>
        <p>The Hindmarsh Child Care Centre, owned by the Greek Orthodox Community of SA, will shut
          its doors on December 19, forcing up to 75 families to find new places for their
          children.</p>
        <p>The closure comes on the back of last month's ABC Learning Centre collapse, which has
          made childcare places increasingly difficult to find.</p>
        <p>Families with children in 22 ABC centres across the state may have to find new day care
          after it was revealed they are likely to close.</p>
        <p>HCCC co-director Sonya Fechner said staff, who were themselves only informed of the
          closure last week, had been unaware the centre was in trouble.</p>
        <p>She said they were trying to find alternative places for the centre's 85 children.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>One of the first things we did, even before ringing the parents, was to ring around
            the local community-based centres because we don't know what the situation was with ABC
            (Learning Centres),</quote> she said. </p>
         <quote>The staff have been disappointed, angry, hurt, upset. It's like a grief
          process.</quote> 
        <p>Parents had been shocked by the closure and were offering to pay higher fees to keep the
          centre open, Mrs Fechner said.</p>
        <p>Greek Orthodox Community of SA general secretary Sylvia Cassoudakis said the centre had
          incurred huge losses.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>That's been cumulative over 10 years, it's just not now,</quote> she said. </p>
         <quote>In 1996-97 we had a consultant come in and they told us it wasn't viable
          then.</quote> 
        <p>Ms Cassoudakis said the centre was never looked at as an economical venture, but as a
          strictly non-profit service.</p>
        <p>Tamara Morena, of Croydon, said she was trying to find an alternative childcare place for
          her son, Lewis, 3, who had been attending HCCC since he was eight months old.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>There are places around but I want to get him in to a place where he's got friends
            going to that centre,</quote> she said. </p>
        <p>Liquor, Hospitality and Miscellaneous Workers Union branch secretary David Di Troia said
          the timing of the HCCC closure placed stress on everyone involved.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Closures are particularly difficult in the lead-up to the festive season as staff
            face uncertainty over their future job prospects coming into the New Year . .
          ,</quote> Mr Di Troia said. </p>
        <p>HCCC staff will be paid up to December 31.</p>

        <p>AUTHORITIES said yesterday 150 whales died in the mass stranding off Tasmania's west
          coast over the weekend - almost double the original tally.</p>
        <p>The Department of Primary Industries and Water said the original number of about 80

        <byline property="dc:creator">LAUREN NOVAK, TORY SHEPHERD, LAURA ANDERSON</byline>
        <p>THERE are plenty of childcare places across Adelaide for children attending troubled ABC
          Learning centres, say industry leaders.</p>
        <p>However, parents may have to go out of their way to find them.</p>
        <p>Calls by The Advertiser found other childcare providers in nearby areas had received few
          calls from panicked parents, but this was expected to change as the news sank in.</p>
        <p>Childcare SA executive member Jo Crichton said she had seen at least four centres with
          vacancy signs recently in the eastern and southern suburbs.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It's easy to get in to other centres if people look around,</quote> she said. </p>
         <quote>I think people are shopping too close to their own backyard.</quote> 
         <quote>Perhaps they should try closer to their work.</quote> 
         <quote>There are plenty of vacancies from what I gather.</quote> 
        <p> Childcare Association of SA president Barbara Langford said there was <quote>a perception
            that getting into other centres is really difficult</quote> . </p>
        <p>
           <quote>A lot of centres aren't at capacity, depending on their location,</quote> she
            said. <quote>There are plenty of places out there, there's still room, people just need
            to look.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> Ms Langford is opening a 70-place centre in Chancery Lane, city, in January but said she
          had received <quote>very few</quote> calls from parents of children at ABC centres. </p>
        <p>Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard last week stressed that the 386 ABC Learning centres,
          still under review by the receiver, were not destined for</p>
        <p>closure.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">CALLIE WATSON</byline>
        <p>THE growth rate of first homebuyers in South Australia over the past decade is the second
          slowest in the country.</p>
        <p>An RP Data study shows the percentage of first homebuyer dwellings financed in South
          Australia in September, 2008m, was 16 per cent - compared with 15.5 per cent in 1998.</p>
        <p> HIA chief economist Harley Dale said SA's weak result was not surprising, given home
          affordability has been low for <quote>a very long time</quote> . </p>
        <p>But he expects the impact of the increased first home owners grant, which doubled from
          $7000 to $14,000 for existing homes in October, to be first felt early next year.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>The first two quarters of next year are when we'll really start to see a boost in
            numbers as a result of the grant increase,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>Although SA and NSW were the only states to record positive growth in the 10-year period,
          SA is ranked second lowest behind the ACT at 15.5 per cent.</p>
        <p> First homebuyer Mark Pryor moved into his Golden Grove townhouse last week. The
          salesman, 25, started looking for a home about six months ago and said the increased first
          homeowner grant had made him want to enter the property market <quote>even more</quote> . </p>
        <p>
           <quote>That definitely made me get stuck into it and start looking a lot harder than I had

        <p>RECESSION fears have fuelled predictions interest rates will be slashed by a full
          percentage point when the Reserve Bank of Australia meets tomorrow.</p>
        <p>Economists are unanimous there will be a rate cut as the RBA strives to insulate
          Australia from the worst financial crisis in decades.</p>
        <p>Eleven of the 18 economists surveyed expect rates to be cut by 75 basis points, taking
          the official cash interest rate to 4.5 per cent for the first time since June, 2002,
          following a 75 basis points cut last month.</p>
        <p>This would mean a drop of $140.57 in monthly payments on the average South Australian
          mortgage of $281,035.</p>
        <p>Five of the economists polled are tipping an even larger 100 basis point rate cut which
          would take the cash rate to 4.25 per cent.</p>
        <p>Rates have not been below this level since the RBA began publishing its overnight cash

        <h property="dc:title">Stamp duty bill has doubled in just five years</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">LAURA ANDERSON, CANBERRA</byline>
        <p>THE average amount South Australian home buyers are paying in stamp duty has doubled in
          the past five years, from $6000 to $12,000.</p>
        <p>A report to be released today will find a 102 per cent rise in the state's median stamp
          duty bill, compared to only a 33 per cent rise in income.</p>
        <p>The highest stamp duty bills were found in the council areas of Walkerville, Burnside and
          Unley, where median house prices were in excess of $600,000.</p>
        <p>In these areas, homeowners paid stamp duty bills of about $30,000 - representing
          one-third of income.</p>
        <p>In Adelaide, the median stamp duty was found to have risen from $6730 in 2003 to
          $13,580.</p>
        <p>The BankWest Residential Stamp Duty report found South Australians needed to work for
          almost two and a half months to cover a median stamp duty bill.</p>
        <p>South Australia's increase of 102 per cent in stamp duty compared to a national rise of
          59 per cent.</p>
        <p>BankWest retail chief executive Ian Corfield said the report showed the need for reform
          of stamp duty, to help South Australian homebuyers.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>This is the downside of the housing price boom that has pushed up stamp duty bills
            and burdened homebuyers with an additional tax expense,</quote> he said. </p>
         <quote>Half of Australia's capital cities now need to set aside more than 20 per cent of
          their incomes for stamp duty bills to buy a new house.</quote> 
        <p>A spokesman for Treasurer Kevin Foley said stamp duty stayed unchanged from 2003 to 2008,
          and that any rise in the median stamp duty was due to increasing house prices.</p>
        <p>He said first home-buyers in South Australia had access to a $4000 grant, in addition to
          the Federal Government's first home owners grant.</p>
        <p>The report said SA had not adjusted the tax threshold since 2003, despite a significant
          increase in house prices.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">LAURA ANDERSON, POLITICAL REPORTER, CANBERRA</byline>
        <p>WATER Minister Penny Wong has intensified pressure on Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull
          over the Murray-Darling Basin, warning he will be blamed for stalling water reform if he
          blocks a key water Bill this week.</p>
        <p>A showdown is brewing in Parliament this week over the Federal Government's Water
          Amendment Bill. Senator Wong is determined to pass the Bill before Parliament rises for
          the year on Thursday, but the Opposition and balance-of-power senators are threatening to
          block the move.</p>
        <p>The Bill would establish a national approach to managing the Basin, including the
          creation of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>This Bill is what Mr Turnbull said he wanted - a basin-wide
          approach,</quote> Senator Wong told The Advertiser yesterday. </p>
        <p> She said Bill amendments being moved by the Liberals could not be accepted, as they
            would <quote>scuttle the Bill</quote> . </p>
        <p>All states, with the exception of Victoria, had referred their powers to the Commonwealth
          and the amendments would undermine this, she said.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We won't be accepting any amendments that jeopardise the reforms,</quote> she said. </p>
         <quote>We are not going to agree to anything that the states did not agree to.</quote> 
        <p>The Liberal Party is refusing to state whether it will continue to block the Bill in the
          Senate if its amendments are killed by the Government.</p>
        <p>The amendments successfully moved by the Opposition and key balance-of-power senators
          include an amendment to block the construction of a controversial $750 million pipeline
          which will deliver 75 billion litres of water to Melbourne.</p>
        <p>Opposition environment spokesman Greg Hunt said the Liberal Party would step up its
          anti-pipeline campaign today by introducing private member's Bills into both Houses. He
          said the Opposition wanted to see its amendments passed.</p>
        <p> Independent Senator Nick Xenophon said: <quote>There is no sense in sucking 75 billion
            litres a year out of a struggling river system.</quote>

        <byline property="dc:creator">ANDREW FENTON, FILM WRITER</byline>
        <p>FUNNYMAN Frank Woodley's animated comedy about a divine chicken that poos lotto numbers
          has won the Gold Shorts Award at the 2008 SHORTS Film Festival in Adelaide.</p>
        <p>Chicken of God took the top honour of the five-day festival at the closing awards
          ceremony last night at the Queen's Theatre.</p>
        <p>The nine-minute film tells the story of a couple on a vineyard who discover the face of
          Jesus in their chicken's comb.</p>
        <p>Woodley says the initial idea for the film came from Lano and Woodley's stage manager,
          Clem Stamation, who went on to painstakingly animate the film over a period of two
          years.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We were driving to a gig and throwing ideas around and for some reason he had the
            idea of choosing Tatts lotto numbers by feeding a bird numbered beads and the numbers
            they pooed out were your numbers,</quote> he laughed. </p>
        <p> He said they were also inspired by news stories about people discovering
            religious <quote>images</quote> in burnt toast. </p>
         <quote>We thought `wouldn't it be funny if that was God's way of communicating with people'
          and just ran with the idea.</quote> 
        <p>Woodley's prize is a trip to next year's Cannes International Film Festival, including
          return air fares and accommodation.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I haven't really taken in what going to Cannes will mean,</quote> he
            said. <quote>I'll have to have my teeth whitened!</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Ben Wade, from the ACT, took out the Silver Shorts Award with his film, Mr Bear &amp; Mr
          Rabbit and Eddie White, from SA's People's Republic of Animation, received the Bronze
          Shorts Award for Sweet &amp; Sour.</p>
        <p>Other prize winners included Adelaide filmmaker Steve Callen's You Better Watch Out, Kick
          Start by Matt Palmer from NSW, My Shout by Julian Argus from WA and Pleasance by Amy
          Gebhardt from NSW.</p>
        <p>The SHORTS festival, which was cancelled at the last minute in 2007, came back bigger
          than ever this year with record attendances and screenings of 74 films from Australia and
          the UK.</p>
        <p>The judging criteria for the festival rewards strong narratives.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>The SHORTS festival focus really is on how well you tell a story so it's really
            flattering they've chosen our film looking at it that way,</quote> Woodley said. </p>

        <p>THE news about the $100 million tram extension to the Entertainment Centre should make
          every person living south of the Onkaparinga River very angry.</p>
        <p>They already have a very comprehensive bus service past the Centre. Why spend a hundred
          million dollars or more to send a tram down there as well?</p>
        <p>The people going to the Entertainment Centre are going there for pleasure. We in the
          south need our train, and need it fast, to get to work.</p>
        <p>I call on this Government to please get their priorities right and look after the working
          people of the south, not those going out for fun.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Vigilance vital on our roads</h>
        <p>THE road safety plea from Police Commissioner Mal Hyde, backed by political and industry
          leaders, is a timely reminder to all South Australians of the dangers we face leading up
          to the school holidays, Christmas and New Year period.</p>
        <p>As we enter the final month of the year, the state is on the verge of keeping its road
          toll under 100 for the first time since records were kept in 1950.</p>
        <p>The Advertiser and South Australia Police Countdown 100 campaign is aimed at keeping the
          2008 road toll under three figures. While this would be a fantastic achievement -
          especially considering the toll peaked at 382 in 1974 - there has still been 88 people
          killed on our roads this year. It is 88 too many and 88 sets of families and friends whose
          Christmas has been devastated by the senseless tragedies of their loved ones.</p>
        <p>And as the Motor Accident Commission has rightly pointed out, there has also been more
          than 1100 serious injury crashes this year which only adds to the horror toll. In the past
          year alone, innocent victims of road crashes in the state have been compensated more than
          $400 million, which is funded by all motorists through registration fees.</p>
        <p>Road crashes, however, are not just about the monetary cost to the community, they are
          about the lives of individuals ending or others' changing forever.</p>
        <p>Vigilance on our roads is the barrier between life and death and every single one of us
          can do our bit to make them safe. There can be no room for complacency whether you're
          driving, a passenger in a vehicle or a pedestrian.</p>
        <p>Speeding, drink or drug-driving, inattention, not wearing seatbelts and fatigue are the
          most common causes of road deaths and injuries. So the message is clear: don't speed,
          don't drive with drugs or excess alcohol in your system, pay attention to the roads, wear
          a seatbelt and stay alert.</p>
        <p>Don't let yourselves and others down. It's just not worth it.</p>

        <p>THE Rann Government seems happy to blow $100 million on a tramline extension that
          benefits a small percentage of taxpayers at a time when the state Budget could well run
          into deficit.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Government ignores advice of the financial benefits to the state in
          hosting the 2018 Commonwealth Games.</p>
        <p>This is further evidence that they are an arrogant government who do not listen, do not

        <h property="dc:title">Saving lives in the water</h>
        <p>A DECISION by the State Government to replace its water safety program for young children
          deserves scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Recreation and Sport Minister Michael Wright has the prerogative to review and update
          programs, such as Vacswim, funded by his department. Community and water safety
          organisations also have the right to be consulted on any significant changes.</p>
        <p>The changes to the 2009 program are significant. The Government argues the emphasis will
          now be on personal water-safety skills for younger children, rather than on children
          learning how to rescue other people while in the water.</p>
        <p>Yet last financial year 27 children under five drowned after falling or wandering into a
          swimming pool, river, lake, dam or lagoon. For every one drowning, there are five near
          drownings, which often results in a major trauma and brain injury that leaves those
          children severely disabled. When these incidents occur, older siblings are often providing
          primary care.</p>
        <p>As summer begins today, parents need to be reassured the Vacswim program remains focused
          on ensuring every child can be a lifesaver if required.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Where is the charity?</h>
        <p>NOT only is the RSL penalised for attempting to raise funds for charity but many
          community service club organisations find themselves in the same boat.</p>
        <p>Our Lions Club, which has been selling our Christmas stocking raffle tickets and cakes in
          shopping centres within our local district for 29 years, has had to abandon this
          fundraiser because of the exorbitant charges money-grabbing shopping centre managers have
          chosen to impose.</p>
        <p>They charge $55 for three days or $110 for five, which is well outside our means. The
          monies we raise are used to fund breakfast programs for local primary schools, assistance
          to those in need within the local area, hearing dogs, cranio-facial foundation assistance,
          children's mobility walkers and many other projects.</p>
        <p> It appears that the grab for the dollar is more important to the management of these
          shopping centres than to give something back to the very community which maintains their
          existence. Yes, <quote>how some have forgotten</quote> . </p>

          didn't save them.</p>
        <p>It won't do any good because, with the decisions made in the U.S., they'll be producing
          the wrong four-cylinder cars. They'll be yesterday's four-cylinder cars, not
          tomorrow's.</p>
        <p>America is no longer the leader in the world; it has become a huge military, economic,
          diplomatic, social and political boat anchor holding the world from moving forward.</p>
        <p>It is the biggest force in the world preventing everyone else from solving today's real
          problems.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Protect the dolphins</h>
        <p> COLIN Thomas ( <quote>Give our dolphins a chance</quote> , The Advertiser, 27/11/08) is
          right - it's time we showed some consideration to other animals on this planet. </p>
        <p>Our dolphins are unique, choosing to share this wonderful city with us even though the
          water in the Port River is polluted.</p>
        <p>The dolphin infant mortality is high as mothers milk is toxic from fish dolphins have
          eaten. So why would we want to take their fish from them?</p>
        <p>As a volunteer for the Whale Dolphin Conservation Society, I recently witnessed the
          heartbreak and grief of staff that care for these dolphins and the dedication of
          organisations committed to rescuing these animals.</p>
        <p>Please don't let their work go unrecognised. Let's show some respect by having fishing
          banned in their habitat.</p>

        <p>THE River Murray and Lower Lakes has taken a back seat to the world financial crisis. But
          the tragedy of the ailing Murray is continuing with so much buck-passing and so many
          excuses.</p>
        <p>As the Lakes recede, what is happening to the wetlands of the Finnis River, Currency
          Creek and the Goolwa Bird Sanctuary?</p>
        <p>Lake Bonney has received a reprieve in Water Security Minister Karlene Maywald's
          electorate.</p>
        <p>Victoria still lays claim to the Murray and the verbal fighting continues.</p>
        <p>Is it too hard for the Government to keep the people of the Lower Lakes informed of their
          intentions, or have they none?</p>
        <p>The environmental and personal tragedy is there for all to see. A high price for
          government's mismanagement.</p>
        <p>Are the Lower Lakes now forgotten? Are they going to be allowed to die? I simply ask the
          question: why?</p>

        <p> ELDER'S Rural Services Manager Mike Guerin ( <quote>Elders plan to beef up push for Asian
            markets</quote> , The Advertiser, 28/11/08) is one of the few people who see nine billion
          people by 2050 and declining arable land as a cause for optimism. While the world
          financial crisis has pushed the food crisis from the headlines, the latter hasn't gone
          away. </p>
        <p>Australia is a major player in the world starvation market with our livestock consuming
          11 million tonnes of grain annually. Our cattle consume almost 6 million of those tonnes
          but Mr Guerin will remain up-beat so long as cattle can continue to outbid the poor in the
          grain market and he can continue to make money.</p>
        <p>The other great winners with increasing beef consumption in China will be the bowel
          cancer surgeons. Red meat causes 6000 new cases annually here, so think of the scope for
          growth in China.</p>
        <p>Send your children to medical school, give them a skill with a future involving travel
          and adventure. Have scalpel, will travel.</p>

        <p>Log on to adelaidenow.com.au/opinion @</p>
        <p>Solve it, Mr Rann</p>
        <p>Readers call on Premier Mike Rann to show courage, vision and leadership to end the
          impasse with teachers.</p>
        <p> I THOROUGHLY endorse the call by Stephen Orr ( <quote>Breaking the Stalemate</quote> ,
          26/11/08) for the Premier to intervene in the ongoing dispute between the Government and
          public education workers. </p>
        <p>Although I have retired from teaching, I have, like Stephen, taught in both the public
          and private education sectors. Now as a grandmother, I despair of the current atmosphere
          in which public education staff</p>
        <p>must work.</p>
        <p> Speaking on February 6, 2000, as Leader of the Opposition, Mike Rann criticised the
          Olsen government, saying that <quote>good, decent professional teachers have been daily
            belittled and daily dishonoured by (the) government . . . Never has the mood of those
            teachers been worse.</quote> Mr Rann promised then to bring <quote>the hope, fire, the
            vision of a Labor Government committed to education.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> Instead, in 2008, what we see is <quote>good, decent caring professional teachers being
            daily belittled and dishonoured</quote> by the Rann Government. The teachers' battle is
          for their students first and their hip pocket a </p>
        <p>far second.</p>
        <p>It is clearly time for Mr Rann to act with integrity. This dispute must not be allowed to
          continue into the new school year.</p>
        <p>MARY GALLNOR, Kensington.</p>
        <p>Amazing tirade</p>
        <p>MR Rann should not be blamed for his recent amazing tirade against teachers. He
          apparently does not know about the time, energy and professional skill that teachers apply
          to their vital work in classes and with individual students.</p>
        <p>Moreover, perhaps it is not his fault that he has a Minister of Industrial Relations who
          does not know an ambit claim when he sees one. Or Minister of Education who has been
          unable to negotiate an unambiguous and improved staffing arrangement with schools. Now
          that he knows this, it is time for him to personally resolve this unprecedented mess.</p>
        <p>ROGER BOTH, Glenalta.</p>
        <p>Strike rolls on</p>
        <p>LIKE a broken record the teachers' strike rolls on after some 12 months of continued
          uncertainty, affecting all involved: Students, teachers and parents. To be honest, the
          general public have had enough. Inaction on the part of our Government seems to have
          become the norm.</p>
        <p>It's time for Media Mike to become Mike the Man. Our chosen representatives should be
          leading by example considering the huge impact our education has on our long-term
          future.</p>
        <p>Our teachers are suffering from the denigration in the media by many who appear to have
          no idea what they are talking about.</p>
        <p>It is very apparent that the education system needs a complete overhaul, increased
          funding and more teachers. Yet Mr Rann can't even run the inadequate system we have.
          Please find some balls Mr Rann.</p>
        <p>MARK M. ALDRIDGE, Virginia.</p>
        <p>Level playing field</p>
        <p>TO the advocates of performance pay for teachers, what happens to those like myself who
          teach in a school of considerable disadvantage. If we are going to be fair and reasonable
          about performance pay then how does one construct a level playing field for the purposes
          of comparing?</p>
        <p> Schools in my area will always underscore when compared with those of
            the <quote>leafy-green</quote> suburbs. </p>
        <p>If we use the national assessment tool (NAPLAN) results for Years 3, 5, 7 and 9, then we
          generate a picture over two years. Which teacher gets the credit: The one who did the
          first 18 months or the one who had the last six months?</p>
        <p>To be fair we ought to be testing in January to establish base-line data, then again in
          December every year. To that we need to apply an index of complexity to level out the
          playing field.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Lesson learned</h>
        <p>NOW isn't that wonderful? We have a Premier who has clearly shown how much he values the
          people who teach the future generation. The headlines about Mr Rann unleashing an attack
          on the teachers' union should instead have said that Mr Rann unleashed an attack on
          teachers and SA education.</p>
        <p>Mr Rann, you have sealed your fate at the next election. I regrettably voted for your
          Government because I thought Labor valued education and the people who worked in it.</p>
        <p>I will no longer be voting for your Government. As a teacher of 28 years, I have never
          felt as undervalued and as angry as I have been recently. Your insensitive comments and
          attack on teachers has been appalling.</p>
        <p>How can you condemn people who are passionate about education? Why would we not fight for
          better conditions and salaries to ensure that we have one of the best public education
          systems in the world?</p>
        <p>I want to ensure, as a teacher and a parent, that my children, my grandchildren
          deservedly receive the best public education I can possibly fight for. I am surprised you
          wouldn't do the same for your family.</p>
        <p>Your comments and your complete inaction in valuing and acknowledging the hard work that
          teachers do has just brought the profession to an all-time low.</p>
        <p>What is disappointing is that all the other states have acknowledged their teachers by
          granting them their pay rises and improving their conditions of service.</p>
        <p>We will soon have a national curriculum. Why not a national salary for all teachers? Why
          does this Government insist on turning this into a political and personal power issue?</p>
        <p>I am fed up and disillusioned with this Government but I will not stop fighting for
          something I feel passionate about. Isn't that what we encourage our students to do - to
          stand up for what they believe in?</p>

        <p>STILL the teachers and the politicians are deadlocked. In truth it's the Education
          Department that needs the overhaul.</p>
        <p>Teachers should not be social welfare assistants who are also required to supply
          self-justifying documentation to keep their posts. Senior staff should not be school
          business managers competing for enrolments to gain more funding.</p>
        <p>Public education is about teaching, first the basics, then all the rest, not running
          competitive businesses.</p>
        <p>Teachers have plenty to do without being burdened by non-teaching duties, forced to teach
          subjects they don't know, and finally having to take strike</p>
        <p>action.</p>
        <p> It's not the money but the misdirected education policies perpetuated over decades by
            newfangled <quote>methodologists</quote> forever <quote>improving</quote> the system. Too
          many babies have been thrown out with the bathwater. </p>
        <p> It's time the education department returned from its Shangri-la <quote>holiday</quote> and
          got back to proper education work. Restore the teaching profession instead of undermining
          it. </p>

        <p>COULD the powers that be extend the month of December to six weeks to give us more time
          to pay off our lay-bys for Christmas, have more Christmas functions and be in a festive
          mood for a longer period of time? To counter-act the extension, the month of July could be
          shortened by two weeks, as this is usually the coldest month of the year.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">In gloomy times leave the lights on</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">WITH REX JORY</byline>
        <p>THIS wretched international financial crisis is beginning to change us as a community. We
          are developing a culture of denial, of blame and self-harm. We are beginning to thrash
          ourselves with nettles.</p>
        <p>It was epitomised last week in a letter to the editor of The Advertiser from M. Taylor of
          Aldinga Beach. Correspondent Taylor argued that, in an age when we are being encouraged to
          conserve energy by turning off lights and unused appliances, we are still putting in
          Christmas lights.</p>
        <p>The writer says Christmas lights are no longer celebratory but are self indulgent.</p>
        <p>I have no issue with M. Taylor. I understand the argument. I just think it's twaddle.
          It's the same woolly-headed thinking which prompted a ban on the use of metal knives on
          aircraft while allowing four-pronged metal forks and glass bottles. Superficially it is
          sound but it's actually nonsense.</p>
        <p>In times of financial, personal and emotional pain and deprivation, small pleasures,
          particularly those which benefit a significant number of people, help ease discomfort and
          maintain balance and perspective. They help perpetuate an image of solidity, certainty and
          normality. They provide a base.</p>
        <p>Christmas lights in public streets and parks, as well as in private homes, are a classic
          example of this collective escapism. They were here last year, so they will be here next
          year. Take them away and people are less certain.</p>
        <p>If the hair-shirt philosophy of M. Taylor of Aldinga was to take root and flourish, the
          community would slump into dejection and negativity. We would become like communist North
          Korea - grey, grim, regimented and deprived of all but the bare necessities.</p>
        <p>In times of stress people need a window of sanity. They need a well-lit pathway in the
          shadow of despair. Even as the SS Titanic was sinking in the North Atlantic in 1912 the
          band played on.</p>
        <p>People held their spirits and their nerves by singing.</p>
        <p>M. Taylor wants no Christmas lights, no distractions from hardship and worry. It's as if
          the Taylorites want us to be punished because of an economic hiccup which is not of our
          making. We should suffer in gloomy silence, whip ourself with nettles.</p>
        <p>What else would the Taylorites suggest? No Christmas carols in the park? Next year's
          Credit Union Christmas Pageant is an unnecessary indulgence and we don't want jolly old
          Santa bobbing up in retail stores and children's parties, heaven forbid.</p>
        <p>Fun places like the Adelaide Zoo and fabulous Monarto, the Botanic Garden, national parks
          and beaches would be closed.</p>
        <p>Live theatre, once the cheap entertainment of the masses and movies cost money and
          24-hour-a-day television attracts low audience numbers after midnight so we could limit
          television from 5pm</p>
        <p>to midnight.</p>
        <p>If the concern is the conservation of energy all but essential use of cars would be
          banned. No driving to work when there's a perfectly adequate public transport system and
          no weekend drives to the beach or the wine districts. Public fountains would be stilled,
          artificial lakes drained, public entertainment silenced, public spirits broken.</p>
        <p>Curiously, this is the very culture we are trying to eradicate.</p>
        <p>Now is not the time to perpetuate and consolidate pessimism and collective hardship. It
          is precisely the wrong time to turn off the lights. What is needed now is not pessimism
          but hope. Not tears but laughter, not capitulation but defiance. Not shadow but sunlight.
          Let us eat cake.</p>
        <p>Governments are striving to kick-start the economy with lavish spending, generous
          pensioner handouts, business stimulation and taxation concessions. All good, all
          necessary. But in the end only one thing is going to restore economic stability and
          prosperity - individual and community confidence.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Wills may not be enough to pass on assets</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">JOHN GOLDBERG</byline>
        <p>HOW many times have you read an article saying that you need to have an up-to-date will?
          I am not about to repeat that message. What I have to tell you is a little bit different,
          namely that a will alone may not be sufficient to pass your assets to your beneficiaries
          on your death.</p>
        <p>Why do I say that? The purpose of a will is to deal with what you own at the time you
          die.</p>
        <p>There are some assets that you cease to own the moment you die, there are some that you
          have never owned, only controlled, and there are some that cannot be dealt with by your
          will.</p>
        <p>If this is news to you, and I suspect it is, read on. Let me start with jointly owned
          property. If you jointly own a house (normally with a spouse) and you hold it as joint
          tenants, which is the usual way, on the death of either of you it automatically passes to
          the other. This is so no matter what your will might say.</p>
        <p>Next are family trusts. A large number of Australians hold property and other assets in a
          family trust. This is done as a means of protecting the assets and there may be tax
          benefits.</p>
        <p>Even though you have total control over your family trust, technically you do not own the
          assets in it. This means that if you were to go bankrupt, the assets remain safe. The
          Family Court looks at assets you control as well as assets you own, so in a divorce they
          will be taken into account.</p>
        <p>In any event, the assets in a family trust do not pass through your will. If you wish to
          transfer control of your family trust on your death, someone will need to have a good look
          at the family trust deed. You may or may not be able to transfer control through your
          will; it depends on the wording of the deed.</p>
        <p>If not, there are other ways.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is superannuation. A lot of people think that they can deal with their
          superannuation fund in their will. That is not the case.</p>
        <p>Some funds permit binding nominations to pass the funds either to a member's estate or to
          their dependants. A binding nomination is not made through a will but by a separate
          document. It takes a particular form and it must be renewed every three years.</p>
        <p>If properly prepared, the trustees must carry out your wishes. If you do not make a
          binding nomination, the trustees have a discretion about where the money goes on your
          death (except for some government superannuation schemes). You can tell them what you want
          but you do not have the final say; they do.</p>
        <p>Which type of super fund do you have?</p>
        <p>I go back to what I said at the start. I am not going to ask you whether you have an
          up-to-date will. What I will ask you instead is: Have you given thought to how your assets
          will pass on your death?</p>
        <p>This advice is, of course, very general. It is no substitute for seeking legal advice.
          Who knows, you might even want to talk to a lawyer about the subject.</p>

            <ln>A BRIGHT future for television in South Australia was predicted by Mr Oliver J.
              Nilsen, one of Australia's leading electrical engineers, last night. Mr Nilsen, whose
              company has an interest in the Melbourne commercial TV station GTV9, said that in
              Melbourne the standard of the technical side of TV and programmes were high. Adelaide
              transmitting and viewing conditions should be ideal, he said. TV stations in capital
              cities were able to make good use of films of sporting and other big outdoor events in
              Australia, with commentaries synchronised on recording tape. These were flown between
              cities and were used on television as soon as possible after the actual event.</ln>

            <ln>A Bill to let a terminally ill person direct that no extraordinary measures be taken

              introduced by (the Minister of Agriculture) Mr Blevins after the recommendations of
              the Legislative Council Select Committee in September, 1980. The Bill passed the
              Council in November, 1980, and was sent to the Assembly, but lapsed because it had not
              been debated before the end of the parliamentary session. It was reintroduced into the
              Assembly in September, 1981, but lapsed again. It was restored on to the notice paper
              on August 31 this year.</ln>

          Appointed by the Labour Government of Clement Attlee, Lord Mountbatten is said to have
            exclaimed: <quote>I am a socialist but my butler is a Tory</quote> . It makes you think. </p>
        <p> Lord Mountbatten wanted to give India independence as fast as possible. The problem was
          the country was deeply divided between Hindus and Muslims. Many of the leaders of the
          Indian independence movement were resolutely opposed to partition. Mahatma Gandhi famously
            said: <quote>My soul rebels against the idea that Hinduism and Islam represent two
            antagonistic cultures and doctrines. To assent to such a doctrine is for me a denial of
            God</quote> . </p>
        <p>Lord Mountbatten didn't agree. For right or for wrong - and there are arguments both ways
          - Britain decided to split the country. He created the new Muslim homeland of Pakistan -
          but it comprised an eastern and western region, separated by the width of northern
          India.</p>
        <p>The partition of India itself was a massive undertaking of ethnic cleansing, shifting
          around 14 million people and leaving an estimated 1 million people dead.</p>
        <p>Lord Mountbatten left the thorny question of Kashmir largely unresolved - which it still
          is.</p>
        <p>His work had what we politely call mixed results. There's been war or near war ever since
          in Kashmir; the new geographically divided nation of Pakistan was unworkable, with the
          eastern part eventually seceding, to become Bangladesh.</p>
        <p>Pakistan itself has lurched from crisis to crisis and, for good measure, created the
          detestable Taliban in Afghanistan; and both India and Pakistan have developed nuclear
          weapons so they can threaten each other in ways few other Third World countries can.</p>
        <p>In creating an Islamic state, Lord Mountbatten and his masters in London thought they
          would solve the problem of Islamic extremism in India. They didn't.</p>
        <p>Not only has Pakistan itself been a less than triumphant success but its creation failed
          to solve the perceived problem of Muslims in predominantly Hindu India. There are still
          nearly 200 million Muslims in India today. Indeed, India has the second largest Muslim
          population in the world, after Indonesia.</p>
        <p>It's worth remembering all this history as we look back in horror at last week's massacre
          in what is now called Mumbai and was once Bombay.</p>
        <p>The sub-continent is steeped in communal conflict and has been one of the breeding
          grounds of Islamic - and for that matter, Hindu - fanaticism.</p>
        <p>The murderers in Mumbai are part of a long succession of people who have killed for
          religion on the sub-continent. In the last year alone there have been murderous terrorist
          attacks by Islamic extremists in New Delhi, Bangalore, Jaipur and Ahmedabad. Scores of
          people have been killed and hundreds injured.</p>
        <p>After the attacks on the U.S. in September, 2001, America and its allies went into
          diplomatic overdrive to build coalitions against Islamic extremists. They found a friendly
          and willing partner in India. But behind closed doors, Indian politicians and diplomats
          mumbled disapprovingly that it had taken the West so long to wake up to the problem and it
          was only the deaths of large numbers of Westerners that had galvanised the West into
          action.</p>
        <p>If the West - in particular the Americans - had listened to Indians earlier and more
          intensely, then more might have been done to fight terrorism earlier. Without doubt, they
          were right.</p>
        <p>SINCE that time there has been a perceptible warming of the relationship between India
          and the U.S. and that warming has substantially been because both countries make common
          cause against Islamic terrorism.</p>
        <p>Since September 2001, though, India has been subjected to dozens of terrorist attacks.
          These have been perpetrated by Indian and Pakistan-based groups, with al-Qaida links,
          determined to fight the dominant Hindu religion in India. Fantastic as it may seem to us,
          these people want not just to assert Muslim rights in India but one day to see India
          become a Muslim country.</p>
        <p>Many of these terrorist acts have gone largely unnoticed in the West. The Mumbai massacre
          has been more prominent partly because more have been killed than in many previous
          incidents but also because Westerners have been killed.</p>
        <p>After the Mumbai massacre, the dead will be mourned, the injured healed and any living
          terrorist who escapes hunted down. There will be the usual claims and counter-claims about
          the failure of intelligence and security. But sensible people need to learn from this
          horrific incident.</p>
        <p>First, they need to understand that the Islamic extremist movement may have been put on
          the defensive in recent years but it hasn't gone away. There are still thousands of people
          who will kill innocent people to cause doubt and division among their enemies.</p>
        <p>To achieve their aim of creating a fundamentalist, anti-modern Islamic society they
          believe they need to disrupt normal life in the non-Islamic world and bring modern
          moderate Islamic governments to their knees.</p>
        <p>Secondly, political partisans can put away those childish arguments that this was all
          caused by the Bush Administration. America has had an election and elected a President who
          is a poster boy of the Left.</p>
        <p> If by electing a new President people think terrorism will go away, they've got another
          think coming. On the contrary, the terrorists will want to know if he has resolve and
          courage to maintain the fight or if he is what Osama bin Laden likes to call <quote>a weak
            horse</quote> . </p>
        <p>My guess is there won't be much difference between President Obama's and President Bush's
          approach to the war on terror.</p>
        <p>Why? Because there is no other easy option.</p>

        <p>CHEERS to Entertainment Centre exec Coralie Cheney, left with her beau with a mo for
          Movember, Andrew Terzic. The bubbly brunette is moonlighting as a movie star opposite
          man-about-town Jethro Heller in the short film The Accordian of Chance.</p>
        <p>While Coralie insists acting is just a hobby, the mini movie's director, former Triple M
          announcer Sheridan Stewart, says she and producer Jen Wildwood are serious about their
          craft. Sheridan says they are planning to enter the flick in short film festival
          competitions including Tropfest.</p>

        <p>IN town for Saturday's Stereosonic music festival at Bonython Park, the guys from Sneaky
          Sound System, left, were hoping to indulge in a few bevvies with Aussie cricketers here
          for the Test match against New Zealand.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We are staying in the same hotel,</quote> MC Double D aka Daimon Downey told
          Confidential, adding cheekily: <quote>I want to get p . . . ed with Ponting.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>One of the other headline acts Kaz James, on the other hand, below inset, had set himself
          quite the challenge - three cities in 24 hours.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We played in Melbourne live with the band and I was singing and stuff, and now I'm
            doing a DJ set. We arrived like an hour ago and we fly to Perth in the
          morning,</quote> he said. Kaz also admitted his biggest challenge was to stay healthy for
          the shows. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>I've got to be careful not to get too sick, because I've got to sing all the
            time,</quote> he said. <quote>I couldn't get too mad because I knew I had another show the
            next day. I couldn't blow my voice out.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> But back to Sneaky: The 10,000 Stereosonic supporters had a fan in Miss Connie Mitchell
          who, impressed by the turn-out, was heard to exclaim: <quote>You go Adelaide!</quote>

        <p>AUSSIE swimming legend Neil Brooks has been a bit of a bad boy in his time - drinking 46
          beers on the return flight from the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games which earned him a
          suspension, for starters.</p>
        <p>But yesterday he was the picture of clean living as he competed in the Adelaide
          Challenge, a Triathlon Australia event, at Glenelg, finishing second in his age group.</p>
        <p> And seriously buff - having decided to become <quote>fit and healthy</quote> after tipping
          the scales at 150kg about 18 months ago. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>I was really unfit,</quote> he admits, adding he's dropped 54kg. </p>
        <p> Neil was also proud to show his new self off to Adelaide, which he called home for
          several years in the early noughties. <quote>I was a bit nervous about coming back because
            when I left (Adelaide) five years ago I was probably at the bottom of the

        <p>ONYA Dominic Cassisi, Kane Cornes and Josh Carr, below, who were more than willing to
          pose for a Confidential happy snap at the Australia-New Zealand match at Adelaide Oval on
          the weekend.</p>
        <p>The fellas were soaking up the atmosphere in the SA Brewing Hospitality Tent, with Power
          team-mates including Kane's bro Chad, and Crow Nathan Bock.</p>
        <p>Nice to see Dom, Kane and Chad, who are all in the running for club captain, being good
          sports about their Power-struggle.</p>
        <p>Maybe because it looks like it's anyone's game: No one in the Power camp at the cricket
          seemed to know who the captain will be or when an announcement will be made.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">HELENE SOBOLEWSKI</byline>
        <p>CHRISTMAS is a time of joy but for those grieving a loved one, the season can be
          extremely difficult.</p>
        <p>General and mental health nurse turned medical educator Mark Simpson was motivated to
          study the emotional phenomena of bereavement and grief after the loss of his teenage
          son.</p>
        <p>Mr Simpson will be conducting free seminars on grief this month.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>No-one knows grief until they experience it, and it's from that perspective that I
            present (the seminars),</quote> he said. </p>
        <p> Before his son Ben's death in 2005, Mr Simpson said he would do his best to offer
          advice, but could never really understand how grief felt. <quote>In particular, it's the
            expectations of Christmas that can be so incredibly painful,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p> When people understood how grief affected them and knew what to expect from the process,
          they felt more in control and were in a better position to take care of themselves
            - <quote>to find your own way through the loss</quote> , Mr Simpson said. </p>
        <p>The first of five free seminars will be held tomorrow at 7pm at Blackwell Funerals, 71
          Prospect Rd, Prospect.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Ayatollah casts doubt over U.S. security pact</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">HAMZA HENDAWI, BAGHDAD</byline>
        <p>IRAQ'S top Shiite cleric has expressed concern about the country's security pact with the
          U.S., fearing it gives too much power to the Americans and does not protect Iraqi
          sovereignty.</p>
        <p>Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani's comments fell short of outright rejection but will put
          pressure on Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shiite-led Government to sell the deal to the
          public before Iraqi voters vote in a referendum next year.</p>
        <p>The pact also has to be ratified by Iraq's three-man presidential council.</p>
        <p>Ayatollah Al-Sistani had indicated that he would not object to the pact if it was passed
          by a comfortable majority in Parliament.</p>
        <p>Parliament approved the agreement last week in a session attended by just under 200 of
          the legislature's 275 lawmakers. Of those in attendance, about 150 voted for the pact,
          which would allow American forces to remain in Iraq for three more years.</p>
        <p> The official at Ayatollah al-Sistani's office said the Iranian-born cleric did not
          believe there was a national consensus in favour of the pact and that this <quote>may lead
            to instability in the country</quote> . </p>
        <p>Parts of the agreement were vague, the Ayatollah believed, particularly those pertaining
          to legal jurisdiction over U.S. troops and controls over the exit and entry into Iraq of
          American forces. The pact also did not offer sufficient guarantees to restore Iraq's full
          sovereignty or protect its assets.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, a deadly rocket attack on the U.S.-protected Green Zone at the weekend bore
          the hallmarks of Shiite militiamen. The rocket struck near a U.N. compound, killing two
          foreigners and wounding 15 people.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Prove we backed attacks: Pakistan</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">MUNIR AHMAD, ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN</byline>
        <p>PAKISTAN has demanded evidence to back Indian allegations it was involved in the Mumbai
          attacks while reversing its decision to send its spy chief to aid the inquiry, muddying
          efforts to avert a crisis between the nuclear-armed neighbours.</p>
        <p>Pakistani security officials also warned the government would withdraw its troops from
          the anti-terrorism fight along Afghanistan's border in order to respond to any Indian
          military mobilisation.</p>
        <p>Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi insisted that authorities - including
          intelligence agencies that New Delhi has long accused of sponsoring terrorism - were not
          behind the carnage.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>If they have evidence they should share it with us,</quote> Mr Qureshi
            said. <quote>Our hands are clean.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> His Government also backed off a pledge made on Friday to send the chief of its Inter
          Services Intelligence agency in person. Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari blamed the
          about-face on a <quote>miscommunication</quote> with India. The reversal followed sharp
          criticism from some Pakistani Opposition politicians and a cold response from the army,
          which controls the agency and jockeys with India for influence in the region. </p>
        <p>Two senior Pakistani security officials said the Indians were pointing fingers at
          Islamabad in order to divert attention from its failure to avert the attacks and
          radicalisation among its own Muslim minority. One of the officials, both of whom spoke on
          condition of anonymity, said a further ratcheting up of tension could prompt India to move
          forces toward the Pakistani border.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>All troops from our western border would be withdrawn to redeploy them at the
            eastern border,</quote> the official said. <quote>Not a single soldier will remain there
            and the coalition partners know about it.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Hassan Abbas, a Pakistan expert at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government,
          said the army was probably riled by Indian and U.S. media reports suggesting that New
          Delhi was considering a military response, including airstrikes on suspected militant
          training camps in the portion of Kashmir controlled by Pakistan.</p>
        <p>Indian sabre-rattling was inevitable as parties pander to nationalist sentiment ahead of
          general elections due next year, Mr Abbas said, though he estimated the risk of war as
          slim.</p>
        <p>India has repeatedly accused Pakistan of complicity in terrorist attacks traced to groups
          fighting in Kashmir.</p>
        <p>U.S. President-elect Barack Obama has identified rapprochement between the two countries
          as a main plank of his plan to stabilise Afghanistan and defeat al-Qaida.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Talks of peace as fighting goes on</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">AGENCIES, GOMA, CONGO</byline>
        <p>UNITED Nations special envoy Olusegun Obasanjo said talks with rebel leader Laurent
          Nkunda helped advance peace moves in the Democratic Republic of Congo, even as fresh
          fighting was reported in the east.</p>
        <p> The discussions - which also involved representatives of pro-government Mai-Mai and Hutu
          militia - were <quote>able to advance the cause of peace</quote> , Mr Obasanjo said. </p>
        <p> This was despite Mr Nkunda's insistence that without direct negotiations with the
          government there would be <quote>war</quote> . </p>
        <p>The talks took place amid United Nations reports of fresh clashes in Masisi, 50km from
          the Nord-Kivu provincial capital Goma, between Mr Nkunda's men and the Mai-Mai.</p>
        <p>The closed-door meeting between Mr Obasanjo, the former Nigerian president, and Mr Nkunda
          took place in the rebel-held town of Jomba.</p>
        <p>But afterwards, Mr Nkunda continued to hold out for direct talks with the government of
          Congo President Joseph Kabila.</p>
        <p> Negotiation was <quote>the good way</quote> , Mr Nkunda said after the meeting, though
          warning that <quote>if there is not negotiation, there is war</quote> . </p>
        <p>The Government has rejected the demand.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Kinshasa has not given up its position,</quote> Government spokesman Lambert Mende
          said. He stressed there were <quote>no mechanisms to favour one group over
          others</quote> and that any talks should include all armed groups. </p>
        <p> The cashiered general, who claims he is defending the Tutsi minority in the region, also
          said he wanted members of the Rwandan Hutu militia operating in the region to
            go <quote>back in their country</quote> . </p>
        <p>Shortly before the latest round of talks, Mr Nkunda apologised for the behaviour of his
          fighters before several hundred villagers.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I'm sorry if the soldiers behaved badly and I will always try to instill more
            discipline,</quote> Mr Nkunda said, making veiled reference to UN accusations that his
          men had committed <quote>odious crimes</quote> . </p>
        <p>Mr Obasanjo was accompanied by another African ex-president, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania,
          who represented the African Union at the talks.</p>
        <p> Sendugu Museveni, a leader of the PARECO pro-government militia who attended the talks,
          said he was <quote>very disappointed</quote> with the meeting, describing the two
          ex-presidents as <quote>tourists</quote> who <quote>came to reinforce Nkunda</quote> . </p>
        <p>Meanwhile, French Human Rights Minister Rama Yade has arrived in Kinshasa for a three-day
          visit that will see her visit refugee camps in Nord-Kivu.</p>

        <p>MOSCOW: Russia's top military officer General Nikolai Makarov has banned officers from
          talking publicly about reforms to the armed forces, in an apparent attempt to stem growing
          discontent.</p>
        <p>Six top-ranking officers have also tendered their resignations amid the modernisation of
          Russia's 1.1 million-member armed forces. The Kremlin is grappling with opposition to the
          most sweeping overhaul of the armed forces in more than a generation.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">ANITA CHANG, CHONGQING, CHINA</byline>
        <p>NINE-year-old Anna He stands quietly amid the chaos in her boarding school dormitory on a
          Sunday night, a frenzy of little girls chattering in Chinese as they change the linens on
          rows of wooden beds.</p>
        <p>Anna is an outsider. Her parents are Chinese, but she cannot talk to her schoolmates
          because she grew up in America.</p>
        <p>This small girl with watchful dark eyes was at the centre of one of the longest custody
          battles in the U.S. in recent times, a high-profile, seven-year dispute marked by racial
          and cultural undercurrents.</p>
        <p>On one side were the Bakers, a white family in suburban Memphis, Tennessee. On the other
          were the Hes, immigrants scraping by with low-paying jobs before they returned to
          China.</p>
        <p>Last year the Tennessee Supreme Court ordered Anna returned to the Chinese couple, and
          the family moved to China. After Anna's parents' marriage fell apart, she was sent to
          boarding school and goes home on weekends.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I really don't like living at school,</quote> Anna murmurs in English. </p>
        <p>She was born on January 28, 1999, a few weeks after her father was accused of sexual
          assault by a fellow-student at the University of Memphis. Shaoqiang He lost his
          scholarship and graduate student stipend; he was ultimately found not guilty.</p>
        <p>With little income and no health insurance, the Hes asked an adoption agency to find a
          foster family until they got back on their feet. Anna went to live with Jerry and Louise
          Baker. The Bakers eventually sought to adopt Anna, saying the Hes had abandoned her. But
          Anna's parents wanted her back, and the case wound through four different courts.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I liked America,</quote> says Anna. <quote>I liked to be at school, I liked maths and
            science,</quote> she says. <quote>I have, like, a lot of friends and I get to be with
            everyone that can speak English.</quote> And here? </p>
        <p>
           <quote>At class, I never understand,</quote> she says. And Anna is reticent about
          communicating with other kids in Chinese because <quote>well, they never understand
            me</quote> . </p>
        <p>What are three things she likes about China?</p>
         <quote>Well, let me think . . . well, I have made a friend but now she is gone. Her name was
          Sarah. That's one thing. I'm trying to think of a second thing. Second thing I like about
          China . . . is . . . well, I don't know.</quote> 
         <quote>I don't know . . . There's so many cars and a lot of people smoke. I hate
          that.</quote> 
        <p>
           <quote>I like music . . ,</quote> she says. <quote>It takes the troubles out of my
            mind.</quote>

        <byline property="dc:creator">AMBIKA AHUJA, BANGKOK</byline>
        <p>UNIDENTIFIED assailants set off explosions at anti-government protest sites yesterday,
          wounding 51 people and raising fears of widening confrontations in Thailand's worst
          political crisis that has strangled its economy and shut down its airports.</p>
        <p>The first blast occurred inside Prime Minister Somchai Wongsawat's office compound, which
          protesters seized in August and have held ever since.</p>
        <p>Suriyasai Katasiya, a spokesman for the protest group, said a grenade landed on the roof
          of a tent under which protesters were resting, rolled down to the ground and exploded.</p>
        <p>At least 49 people were injured, said Surachet Sathitniramai at the Narenthorn Medical
          Center.</p>
        <p>He said nine of them were hospitalised, including four in serious condition.</p>
        <p>Twenty-minutes after the compound attack, two more blasts rocked an anti-government
          television station but there were no injuries, Mr Suriyasai said.</p>
        <p>In another pre-dawn strike, an explosive device detonated on the road near the main
          entrance to the domestic Don Muang airport.</p>
        <p>Mr Surachet and an Associated Press television cameraman said two people were
          wounded.</p>
        <p>No one claimed responsibility for the blasts but Mr Suriyasai blamed the Government.
          Tensions were rising as a pro-government group was last night scheduled to hold a rally in
          the heart of Bangkok to express its support for Mr Somchai, who is operating out of the
          northern city of Chiang Mai.</p>
        <p>Mr Somchai has been reluctant to forcibly evict the People's Alliance for Democracy
          demonstrators, who on Tuesday night overran Suvarnabhumi airport, the country's main
          international gateway and one of the busiest airports in the world.</p>

          AustralianSuper - have been in a long-running battle with retail super funds, which are
          typically offered by financial advisers.</p>
        <p>Even amid this year's investment market carnage, industry funds have retained their
          title. The new SuperRatings data follows a recent survey by fellow researcher Chant West
          that showed for the year to September 30 industry funds had the top performers across most
          investment fund types.</p>
        <p>But one of the reasons for industry funds' strength could soon become a drag on their
          performance.</p>
        <p>While retail super funds focus mainly on listed investments such as shares and listed
          property trusts, a big proportion of industry fund investments have been in the unlisted
          space, such as direct property holdings and infrastructure assets.</p>
        <p>Chant West says that on average, industry funds allocate about 32 per cent of members'
          money to unlisted or alternative assets, while the master trusts operated by investment
          giants such as AMP, MLC and Colonial have only 6 per cent of funds in this area.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Unlisted assets, notably direct property, have undoubtedly contributed to the
            recent outperformance of industry funds,</quote> it says. </p>
         <quote>It remains to be seen whether the performance gap will be narrowed or even reversed
          over the next 12 to 18 months if the values of unlisted assets fall to better reflect the
          sentiments in listed markets.</quote> 
        <p>Financial group Dixon Advisory thinks the future is bleak, and last month wrote to its
          16,000 clients urging them to switch out of several industry super funds, which it noted
          had not revalued their unlisted assets down since July to reflect the plunging
          markets.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Most default or balanced funds within industry super funds are probably overvalued
            by 3 per cent to 15 per cent at the current time,</quote> executive chairman Daryl Dixon
          said. </p>
        <p> Barker Wealth Management director and senior adviser Will Henwood said a <quote>big
            question mark</quote> was hanging over industry funds that held unlisted assets. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>The industry is starting to raise more questions about how these unlisted assets
            are priced,</quote> he said. <quote>It's not exactly an apples-for-apples
            comparison.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">Mixed messages in text advertising</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">GRAEME SAMUEL</byline>
        <p>THE best way to deal with unwanted advertising is usually to ignore it. But when it
          arrives on your mobile phone via text message, simply deleting it and hoping it will go
          away can result in charges of hundreds of dollars.</p>
        <p>The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission regularly hears from distraught mobile
          phone owners who have discovered significant fees on monthly bills for premium services
          they didn't realise they had subscribed to.</p>
        <p> In some cases, phone owners responded to a <quote>text to win</quote> competition in a
          magazine or on television without fully reading the terms and conditions. Others have
          unwittingly found themselves bombarded with unwanted SMS and MMS messages after attempting
          to download a game, wallpaper, ring tone or other service online. Premium mobile services
          make their money by trying to sign up users to receive a regular service, rather than a
          one-off. </p>
        <p>For instance, sending a request to receive a horoscope may in fact be an invitation to
          receive several services a week, each charged at several dollars a message.</p>
        <p>To receive such services, you - or someone else - first has to agree by opting in. This
          usually involves calling or texting a number starting with 19, or entering your mobile
          number on a web page. Most service providers abide by the rules, but the ACCC has recently
          taken action against a premium service provider that broke the law. In October, the
          Federal Court found TMG Asia Pacific had misled customers via a series of TV and internet
          pop-up quiz advertisements that asked users to send a text to win a prize.</p>
        <p>What the ads didn't adequately tell customers was they would be signing up to an ongoing
          premium service. They also failed to mention that customers in the ACT, Victoria and
          Queensland were ineligible to win, even though they would be charged for entering. The
          ACCC has several other cases in court or under investigation. Prevention is the best way
          to avoid unwanted phone service fees.</p>
        <p>Treat your mobile phone like a credit card - don't give your number to anyone you don't
          trust. Avoid the temptation to respond quickly to ads or competitions and ensure you know
          what the full cost will be before requesting a service or sending your phone details.</p>
        <p>When unwanted messages arrive, remember that ignoring the problem won't make it go away,
          and may lead to more charges in the long run.</p>

            <hd>SELL: TEN NETWORK</hd>
            <p>Given a weak profit result, a lack of guidance and our recent cuts to economic
              forecasts, we are adopting a harder landing scenario for Ten.</p>
            <p>We now expect a sharper decline in advertising spending in 2009, with the company's
              TV revenues not expected to recover to 2008 levels until 2011.</p>
            <p>Ten remains our least preferred media exposure, facing significant cyclical and
              structural pressures. Cyclically, as the third player in a three-player market, Ten is
              highly exposed to cuts to ad budgets, while structurally the free-to-air model is
              under threat from pay-TV penetration and online video advertising.</p>

            <p>The mid-cap resources stock has seen its share price decimated on the back of very
              weak zinc and copper prices which had led to worse cash flows than originally
              expected.</p>
            <p>There has also been some forced selling relating to margin loans and probably short
              selling as well.</p>
            <p>As OZ Minerals is entering the period of maximum capital expenditure at Prominent
              Hill, management has deferred some other projects with a view to saving around $495
              million in capital expenditure in 2009.</p>
            <p>In the medium term, we expect upside to the share price, but in the short term the
              market will await the refinancing of $US600 million of debt in December.</p>

            <p>Management recently highlighted that the first quarter of 2009 had witnessed high
              single-digit revenue growth across the group, with almost every taxi network
              throughout Australia experiencing growth.</p>
            <p>Net profit after tax growth has been stronger because of cost management efforts.
              Last week, Cabcharge announced it had purchased Victorian bus operator Kefford Group,
              which has an estimated 16 per cent market share of the bus market in Victoria, with 90
              per cent of revenues derived from government contracts.</p>
            <p>In our view, Cabcharge's increased exposure to bus operations is a strategically
              positive move, as it continues to diversify earnings in a weakening economic
              environment.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Boomers facing a bleaker financial future</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ANTHONY KEANE</byline>
        <p>CHILDREN of baby boomers are being warned not to expect the financial inheritance
          kick-start many of their parents have enjoyed.</p>
        <p>Bernie Lewis Wealth Management chief executive Stefan Lipkiewicz says many of the
          so-called generation X - born between 1961 and 1981 - will receive no inheritance and need
          to start planning for retirement now.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>For baby boomers, it was a natural assumption that they would inherit all or part
            of their parents' homes and savings,</quote> he said. </p>
         <quote>Their parents, who were born in the economic hardships of the first half of the 20th
          century, had the attitude that, if you looked after the pennies, the pounds would look
          after themselves.</quote> 
         <quote>In the most part they believed in thrift and leaving whatever wealth they had for
          their children. Now, many baby boomers plan to extinguish their wealth in the 20 or so
          years they expect to live in retirement.</quote> 
        <p>Mr Lipkiewicz said children of the boomers, aged in their 30s and 40s, should be looking
          at areas such as their:</p>
        <p>HOME, which should be paid off as quickly as possible and might have equity that could be
          used in investing.</p>
        <p>PROTECTION through personal insurance to withstand health shocks that might affect their
          ability to repay debts and raise a family.</p>
        <p>REVIEWING and consolidating superannuation funds.</p>
        <p>INVESTING to build wealth outside of the superannuation environment.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>They need to start planning a lot more seriously than their parents had
          to,</quote> Mr Lipkiewicz said. </p>
        <p>He said early planning was something many baby boomers - the generation born between the
          end of World War II and 1960 - had failed to do.</p>
         <quote>The lack of well-structured financial plans and appropriate advice will dramatically
          erode their plans, and we will see many baby boomers struggle to maintain the lifestyles
          they desire.</quote> 
        <p>He said most self-funded retirees would need a lump sum of at least $700,000 for a
          comfortable retirement.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>The reality for many baby boomers is that they will have to make significant
            sacrifices in retirement. This may include selling the family home, not having a social
            life or regular holidays and, at worst, being dependent on others,</quote> Mr Lipkiewicz
          said. </p>

        <h property="dc:title">Choose the right home for your nest egg</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ANTHONY KEANE</byline>
        <p>Money Editor ANTHONY KEANE examines the ongoing battle between industry and retail
          superannuation funds.</p>
        <p>Compare the pair. Anyone who has watched commercial television in the past three years
          must be familiar with this slogan.</p>
        <p> Launched by not-for-profit industry superannuation funds in 2005, the advertising
          campaign has taken a big swipe at retail super funds and the commissions they pay to
          financial advisers. The advertisements' long-term projections for people's superannuation
          savings always illustrate that they are better off financially with their nest egg in an
          industry fund that is <quote>run only to profit members</quote> . </p>
        <p> There have been complaints, copycat campaigns that sparked legal action, and public
          attacks from both sides. <quote>It's a very interesting debate within the industry and one
            that needs to be resolved - it seems to be getting more personal,</quote> said Jeff
          Bresnahan, managing director of research group SuperRatings. </p>
        <p>His company monitors more than 400 super products and 1000 different fund options each
          month, and is behind the projections included in the industry funds advertising.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>They came to us and asked us to crunch the numbers for the Compare the Pair
            campaign,</quote> Mr Bresnahan said. <quote>ASIC (the Australian Securities and
            Investments Commission) has been through the assumptions and we haven't had any negative
            feedback at all from them.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>For several years, industry funds such as REST Superannuation, AustralianSuper and
          Adelaide-based Statewide have been delivering slightly higher investment returns than
          retail funds that are run by companies such as AMP, MLC, BT, Colonial and ING.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>For whatever reason, they have always been up there and they stay there,</quote> Mr
          Bresnahan said. </p>
        <p>But few financial planners recommend clients put their money in industry funds.</p>
        <p>The industry funds say this is because the planners do not receive upfront payments and
          ongoing commissions, while planners say industry funds are not transparent enough and not
          flexible enough with their insurance and investment options.</p>
        <p>Financial services firm PKF does not recommend industry funds to clients.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We might have them on our recommended list if we could find out where they
            invest,</quote> PKF manager financial services Tanya Bradley said. <quote>We just can't
            find out. My biggest bone to pick is the advertising - I don't think it's all true and
            correct. Where does all this money come for this advertising?</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Ms Bradley said industry super funds might be appropriate for people with smaller
          balances who did not need strategic advice in areas such as tax structures and
          transition-to-retirement strategies.</p>
        <p>Marinis Financial Group financial strategist Theo Marinis said there was a place for
          industry funds.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>When you have less than $80,000-$100,000 it's a good place to start,</quote> he
          said. </p>
         <quote>But once you get over that level, the insurance cover might not be as good as you can
          organise externally, the investment choices are not as transparent, the product may not be
          appropriate to your circumstances.</quote> 
         <quote>We don't use industry funds because they're not transparent enough.</quote> 
         <quote>You can't see what the underlying investments are, so you are sort of guessing what
          you are investing in. It's a one-size-fits-all approach, but it works for some
          people.</quote> 
        <p> Mr Marinis said industry and retail super funds could co-exist, but he questioned the
          aggressive advertising campaign. <quote>They say they're there for members only, but if
            they are spending all their money on advertising, where's that coming from?</quote> he
          said. </p>
         <quote>If we didn't add value for the clients, why would they keep coming back and paying
          us?</quote> 
        <p>Adelaide-based Barker Wealth Management is one of the minority of financial planning
          firms that has a significant proportion of clients invested in industry super funds.</p>
        <p> Barker director and senior adviser Will Henwood said at least 40 per cent of the firm's
          clients had an industry fund. <quote>If it's an existing arrangement, we don't like to
            upset the arrangement if it's benefiting the client. It's a case-by-case
            situation,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p> Mr Henwood said some clients were interested in holding direct shares in their
          superannuation or specific asset classes which could not always be done through an
          industry fund. <quote>Most clients respect and understand the need to pay for advice, and
            some prefer to have it taken out of investment earnings of their fund,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>Financial planners get paid through a range of fees such as upfront entry fees, plan
          fees, ongoing service charges and commissions paid by the products they recommend,
          although growing numbers of planners are rebating their product commissions.</p>
        <p>These extra costs paid to planners can easily eclipse 2 per cent a year, although the
          basic investment fee average is more expensive in industry funds, according to research
          group Chant West. It says the typical master trust will charge 0.83 per cent a year on a
          person's portfolio, while an industry super fund charges an average 0.93 per cent, higher
          because it invests more heavily in unlisted and alternative investments that are generally
          more expensive to operate.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>But industry fund members should have no cause to complain, because their higher
            fees have been more than justified by superior performance,</quote> Chant West says in a
          recent report. </p>
        <p> Statewide chief executive Frances Magill said because of the not-for-profit nature of
          industry funds, overheads, management and administration costs were kept as low as
          possible. And with 168,000 members, she said, her fund had the purchasing power to
          negotiate reduced fees from investment providers and cheaper insurance
            premiums: <quote>Statewide does not charge entry or exit fees, contribution fees or
            withdrawal fees and keeps its administration charges to a minimum.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> Ms Magill does not subscribe to the financial planners' view that industry funds are
          only for people with less than $100,000 in super. <quote>Industry funds such as Statewide
            are the best option for all people - low fees and no commission means greater
            flexibility and retirement savings,</quote> she said. </p>
        <p> Financial planners are still not convinced and it is doubtful if or when they ever will
          be. Bourke Shaw Financial Services principal Lawrence Orlando says he does not recommend
          industry funds, <quote>given that I am governed like most financial advisers by the
            approved products list our Australian Financial Services licensees provide</quote> . </p>
        <p>
           <quote>There is also the question of whether industry fund advisers are restricted to
            recommending industry funds,</quote> he said. <quote>Industry funds are mainly focused on
            super and not on your overall financial strategy, such as salary sacrifice or estate
            planning. While industry funds pound our television screens with all the reasons why you
            shouldn't pay commissions or fees to financial advisers, it is extremely important for
            investors to seek professional investment advice from an authorised adviser who can
            understand their goals and objectives and place an appropriate strategy specifically
            designed to their needs.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Some industry funds are now matching many of the services of financial planning
          firms.</p>
        <p>Statewide's Ms Magill said her fund had recently increased its financial planners to
          five, and also offered a master trust platform - Auswide - that gave members access to 30
          investment options run by companies such as AMP and Colonial, which is owned by the
          Commonwealth Bank.</p>
        <p>She said Statewide's financial planners were not forced to only recommend Statewide
          products.</p>
         <quote>If somebody came to us from a very good performing fund with low fees, and it was in
          the best interest of the member, we would give them the advice to stay where they
          are.</quote>

        <p>BHP Billiton ended the week at $31, up from an intraday low on November 21 of only $20,

          announced the sale of two power stations that would enable it to repay a $118 million debt
          facility.</p>
        <p>OPTICAL electronics developer Arasor International stumbled closer to collapse, dropping

        <h property="dc:title">Interest rate shopping can come at a high cost</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">JOHN OLIVER</byline>
        <p>THE Reserve Bank's recent interest rate cuts have prompted many borrowers with fixed-term
          mortgages to look at switching to a variable rate.</p>
        <p>As a fixed-rate mortgage is a contract between yourself and your lender, if you break the
          contract there is every likelihood that you will be liable to pay a fixed rate break cost.
          Break costs for fixed-rate loans can be expensive and are determined by several
          variables.</p>
        <p>The bank has lent you the money at a certain rate and has generally hedged that rate in
          the marketplace as part of their risk-management strategy - this is like insurance and has
          come at a cost to the bank.</p>
        <p>When that contract is broken, there is a cost to the bank. That cost is passed on to the
          borrower as the bank entered into that contract in good faith, with the intent of
          honouring that interest rate until the end of the agreed fixed term.</p>
        <p>In simple terms, the fixed rate break cost is generally calculated by comparing the
          income the bank would have received for the remaining term of the fixed rate contract with
          what the bank will earn by re-lending that money in the marketplace at today's rates for
          the same remaining term. When rates come down quickly, that interest rate gap widens and
          the cost of breaking out of the loan increases.</p>
        <p>The second major variable is the length of time you have had your fixed-rate loan
          relative to the contracted fixed-rate period. For instance, if you break in the fifth year
          of a five-year fixed term, your break costs will be significantly less than if you were
          looking to switch after only one year of a five-year term.</p>
        <p>It is important that you assess the cost of switching your loan against the real
          financial benefit of switching, as in some cases the benefit from lower repayments may be
          outweighed in the short to medium term by the cost of breaking that contract, so what
          seems like a good idea may not deliver the benefits expected.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">KARINA BARRYMORE</byline>
        <p>MOST people are in the dark about the promises their superannuation fund makes because
          only one in four uses clear and specific words to describe their investment
          objectives.</p>
        <p>At a time when people are learning the hard way that their super can lose money, a report
          has found the investment aims of most funds are not clearly stated.</p>
        <p>The wording and descriptions of more than 300 fund options was too vague, meaningless,
          confusing and used selective truth, the research said.</p>
        <p>Jargon skirted around stating specific objectives and investment targets, which meant
          people could not hold the fund manager to account for under-performance, research firm
          SuperRatings said.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Consumers have a right to be able to clearly understand and measure the performance
            of their investment options and that such measurements should be consistent across

        <p>SuperRatings wants the entire industry to use standard wording, such as performance
          against the consumer price index.</p>
        <p> Lobby group National Seniors Australia said the findings supported the feedback it has

        <h property="dc:title">Stakes are high in short term</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ANTHONY KEANE</byline>
        <p>AS the bear market turned from ugly to hideous in recent weeks, several people told me
          that investing in shares was nothing more than a gamble.</p>
        <p>I agree that it is a gamble, but only for those who will need their money in the short
          term - in financial speak, five to seven years.</p>
        <p>Experienced investors who take a long-term view and buy blue-chip companies such as
          Woolworths, BHP Billiton, Westfield and the Commonwealth Bank do not see themselves as
          gamblers.</p>
        <p>Even at its current level - which is the deepest slump in more than 30 years - the share
          market is still up 102 per cent over the past decade if dividends are included.</p>
        <p>That's much better than what cash in the bank has paid. Investing is not gambling, but
          there is often a gambler in every investor.</p>
        <p> I learned a lesson in this year's crash when I took a gamble on a stock in June which
          had already slumped 80 per cent but was still claiming its business was in <quote>robust
            shape</quote> . </p>
        <p>That stock was Babcock &amp; Brown, an investment bank which looks likely to follow the
          likes of ABC Learning Centres and Allco Finance Group into oblivion soon. Shareholders
          rank last on the list of people to get their money back when companies go belly up, so for
          me and thousands of others, our investment will most likely be wiped out.</p>
        <p>I only put 1 per cent of my total portfolio into Babcock &amp; Brown, but a loss is a
          loss and it's painful because I gambled without fully understanding the business.</p>
        <p>You know times are bad when a bloke like Owen Hegarty, who grew mining company Oxiana
          from a minnow to a major miner, had to sell one-third of his shares last month because of
          a margin call, after Oxiana's successor OZ Minerals plunged 88 per cent in the past 13
          months.</p>
        <p>Investors are bleeding everywhere in this current climate, but share market gamblers are
          the only ones unlikely to make a recovery.</p>
        <p>GEMS AMID GLOOM</p>
        <p>Despite the downturn, 10-year investment returns from top companies are strong:</p>
        <p>* A BHP Billiton share has climbed from $5.59 exactly a decade ago to $31 today (up
          455%), and paid $3.64 in dividends.</p>
        <p>* A Woolworths share increased from $5.60 to $26.80 (up 379%), and has paid $4.61 in
          dividends.</p>
        <p>* A Woodside Petroleum share rose from $8.10 to $36.05 (up 345%) and paid $7.62.</p>
        <p>* Commonwealth Bank shares have climbed from $21.95 to $34.09 (up 55%) and paid $18.11
          each in dividends.</p>

          Australia's property market has moderated and interest rates have reduced, making this an
          ideal time to purchase a property.</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">CHRIS WARD</byline>
        <p>But before you start looking, you may well be asking yourself: How much can I afford to
          borrow?</p>
        <p>Before you begin poring over the real estate pages, your first stop should be to your
          bank to gain pre-approval for a home loan.</p>
        <p>Pre-approval helps you to determine the amount you can borrow so that you can begin
          looking for a house, confidently knowing it's within your budget.</p>
        <p>When you visit your local branch or meet with a mobile lender, there is some information
          you'll need to get the pre-approval process started.</p>
        <p>This includes proof of income, either in the form of a letter from an employer or copies
          of pay slips, proof of identity and details of current assets or what you own (including
          savings and other properties). You will also need to provide information on expenses
          including existing loan commitments and limits on credit cards - if you already have a
          budget in place, it will help you to not only save a deposit but you'll have the facts
          about your income and expenses at hand.</p>
        <p>With this information, your bank will be able to calculate your borrowing limit and
          repayment capacity, so it's important to provide accurate details of income and all
          expenses. The amount you can borrow is generally determined by your ability to meet home
          loan repayments. In most cases responsible lenders will factor in several interest rate
          rises to ensure you can continue to pay your mortgage should interest-rate circumstances
          change.</p>
        <p>You should also do the same when you are looking at your own budget. It's easy to do so
          using home loan repayment calculators available on many bank websites.</p>
        <p>Simply calculate your loan repayments at a higher rate of interest. While we've recently
          seen interest rates reduce, it's always safe to factor in at least two rate rises of 0.25
          per cent for each rise. This will allow you to base your budget on managing the increased
          amount.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">RISK Equity the springboard to getting ahead Terry's hot property</h>
        <p>HIS job focuses on property, but Urban Development Institute of Australia (SA) executive
          director Terry Walsh doesn't mind investing in shares too.</p>
        <p>What was your first investment and how did it go?</p>
        <p>When studying my master's in physics, I was itching to invest in the stock market. I
          invested $50 on 1000 shares in Munga Creek Minerals. They disappeared from the ASX, never
          to be seen again. A loss in money, but nevertheless a good investment in knowledge.</p>
        <p>What is your favourite type of investment?</p>
        <p>Both property and shares. Investing in our own house has provided my wife and me with
          both good returns and a sense of ownership, which I value. The shares have been a means of
          generating some wealth, while using equity in our property.</p>
        <p>What is the best investment advice you have received and who was it from?</p>
        <p>Get into the property market as soon as you can. Understanding the benefit from using
          equity in an already-owned investment was the turn-on signal for me. I adopted this view
          after listening to my financial adviser and talking with successful investors. I wish I
          had learned that lesson earlier in my life.</p>
        <p>How do you approach investment risk?</p>
        <p>I have gained confidence in my investment decisions from working alongside knowledgeable
          people at different stages in my career, and my current role offers me a terrific insight
          into the property market. I enjoy assessing all investment opportunities. After taking
          time to consider things, I then attempt to keep my nerve and settle in for the long
          term.</p>
        <p>What has been your best performing investment?</p>
        <p>My houses and managed funds. Establishing a consulting business and learning from people
          with different views on investment, either in shares or property, has helped.</p>
        <p>And the worst?</p>
        <p>Investing in shares after a tip from friends. I think such speculative buys are fun as
          long as they don't constitute your main game of investment.</p>
        <p>Where do you get your information about investing?</p>
        <p>From my financial adviser and lots of reading.</p>
        <p>How would you invest $25,000 if you were given it tomorrow?</p>
        <p>I would use it to develop some land. The future looks attractive for investing in South
          Australian property.</p>
        <p>What about managed funds?</p>
        <p>I favour them. I appreciate using research by someone else and being able to invest in
          assets I could not otherwise invest in as an individual.</p>
        <p>How do you feel about investing overseas?</p>
        <p>It should be done with care. However, Australia is a small world player - so having
          overseas shares as part of the mix seems a good idea.</p>
        <p>Do you have a personal finance budget and do you stick to it?</p>
        <p>Not really. I try to organise my fixed commitments and use the rest to live and spend. My
          two daughters live in Melbourne and Sydney, so my wife and I have lumpy payment schedules
          on airline seats.</p>
        <p>What's the most extravagant purchase you have made?</p>
        <p>An overseas holiday earlier this year, when I visited many urban developments in Europe,
          and realised the history associated with different types of living. Seeing the buildings
          and lifestyles in the Greek islands and in New York were highlights. My golf club
          membership is an ongoing extravagance, given my busy life.</p>

        <p>THE Australian economy is expected to have slowed further in the September quarter, as
          high interest rates crimped consumer spending and the global financial crisis sapped
          business confidence.</p>
        <p>The national accounts report, due to be released by the Australia Bureau of Statistics
          this week, is expected to show gross domestic product grew by 0.2 per cent in the third
          quarter.</p>
        <p>The median market forecast for the annual growth rate is 1.9 per cent. In the June
          quarter, GDP rose by 0.3 per cent, for an annual pace of 2.7 per cent.</p>
        <p>Other economic indicators for the September quarter already show retail sales flatlining,
          building approvals declining and the pace of credit growth slowing.</p>

        <p>AUSTRALIA`S share market is expected to open stronger today on the back of a Friday rally
          on Wall Street, before the focus turns to the next interest rate cut and economic growth
          figures due this week.</p>
        <p>The Reserve Bank of Australia is expected to again cut the official interest rate, this
          time by at least 0.75 of a percentage point, tomorrow.</p>
        <p> U.S. shares have climbed for five consecutive days, up 1.2 per cent on Friday, and
          CommSec chief equities economist Craig James expects local shares to rise about 0.8 per
          cent this morning. <quote>We should get off to a pretty good start . . . as indicators are
            pointing in the right direction, including stocks in the U.S. and Europe and
            gold,</quote> Mr James said. </p>
         <quote>Investors are concluding that Australia isn't in bad shape. Australia has levers such
          as interest rate cuts.</quote> 
        <p>Last week's 9.5 per cent gain in the benchmark S&amp;P/ASX200 index was the biggest
          weekly rise on record.</p>
        <p>The Australian dollar had settled around the US65c mark, and currency investors would be
          watching this week's economic announcements closely, Mr James said.</p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">TONY GRANT-TAYLOR</byline>
        <p>NERVOUS OZ Minerals investors are waiting for an update from the company within the next
          24 hours, after it revealed it was having trouble refinancing two debt facilities
          totalling $US560 million ($855.7 million).</p>
        <p>Shares in OZ - which is developing the Prominent Hill copper and gold mine in South
          Australia - have been in a trading halt since Friday as it sought an urgent answer from
          bankers on whether they would extend time for it to refinance the debt.</p>
        <p>With smaller miner CopperCo last week falling into receivership after the failure of a
          proposed new financing, OZ said on Friday it had undertaken to refinance the two
          facilities - one of $US420 million ($641.8 million) and one of $US140 million ($213.9
          million), by yesterday.</p>
        <p> But it has now requested an extension of time, to January 31, to bed down a new
          syndicated facility. <quote>We have requested a response to this request from the lenders
            during the course of today,</quote> it said on Friday. </p>
        <p>Melbourne-based OZ Minerals, forged from the merger of Oxiana and Zinifex this year, said
          its efforts to sort out the debt facilities had been held up by one bank in the
          syndicate.</p>
        <p> While the bank accepted the extension of time for repayment, it
            demanded <quote>unworkable</quote> caveats, OZ Minerals said. </p>
        <p>Analysts said that if OZ could not conclude the negotiations to convert project financing
          into a single corporate facility, it could be forced into a heavily discounted equity
          raising.</p>
        <p>OZ is already taking steps to cut costs at its Century zinc mine in Queensland, including
          cutting back production. Shares in OZ remain in a trading halt at 55c.</p>

        <p>Keyboard design which has lasted through the years</p>
        <p>Why are the letters on keyboards not in alphabetical order and who was responsible for
          deciding in what order they are placed? - J.M. (Ethelton)</p>
        <p>The most common modern-day keyboard layout on English-language keyboards is known as
          QWERTY. The name comes from the first six characters on the far left of the top row of
          letters.</p>
        <p>The QWERTY design was patented by Christopher Sholes, an American newspaper editor and
          printer, in 1874 and sold to manufacturer Remington the same year, when it first appeared
          in typewriters. Sholes initially started experimenting with the placing of characters to
          avoid mechanical issues with an early typewriter.</p>
        <p>Several changes to the order of characters have been made through the years, including
          the reversal of the positions of the W and E keys to bring E, the most commonly used
          letter in the English language, in line with the strong second finger. Modern keyboards
          retain a layout close to that of the original configuration.</p>
        <p>Gilchrist's debut</p>
        <p>Can you tell me in which state side Adam Gilchrist made his debut? - J.H. (Pt
          Lincoln)</p>
        <p>Adam Gilchrist made his first-class debut for New South Wales during the 1992-1993
          season. Playing purely as a batsman because the team already had a long-standing wicket
          keeper in Phil Emery, Gilchrist had an impressive match. He later went on to score an
          unbeaten 20 in the second innings of the Sheffield Shield final to secure an easy win over
          Queensland.</p>
        <p>He struggled to keep his place in the side, playing only three first-class matches the
          following season. In 1994 Gilchrist joined the Western Warriors in Western Australia,
          where he controversially replaced former Test player Tim Zoehrer as wicket keeper.</p>
        <p>Keeping trees green</p>
        <p>As Christmas is fast approaching I was thinking about buying a real pine Christmas tree
          this season. How long does one last and is it better to put it in a bucket of wet sand or
          water? - J.A. (Rostrevor)</p>
        <p>Cared for correctly, a pine Christmas tree will stay green for up to a month. To ensure
          the best results, cut 2.5cm from the base of the trunk after getting the tree home. This
          exposes fresh wood which can take up water more efficiently than dried-out wood.</p>
        <p>A bucket or stand filled with water is the best way to keep the tree fresh. Check the
          water level two or three times a day for the first few days and then once a day, topping
          up as needed.</p>

        <p>ROD Pampling won the Australian Masters yesterday, beating Australian countryman Marcus
          Fraser with a par on the third play-off hole.</p>
        <p>Both players parred the first two play-off holes, with Pampling holing a testy
          five-footer on the first extra hole. On the second, Fraser made a 20-footer for par after
          hitting his approach into a bunker.</p>
        <p>Pampling closed with a five-under 67 to match Fraser (65) at 12-under 276 on the
          Huntingdale course in Melbourne.</p>
        <p>Australia's Robert Allenby shot a 73 to finish third, three strokes back in the event
          sanctioned by the Australasian and European tours.</p>
        <p>On the third play-off hole, Fraser's putt from off the green nearly went in. He missed
          the return putt of about seven feet for par, while Pampling made a three-footer to clinch
          the 30th anniversary Masters.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>They're never fun to be in, you work so hard for 72 holes then you still have to go
            again,</quote> Pampling said of the play-off. <quote>That was a great battle.</quote> 
        </p>
         <quote>I hit a lot of quality shots and all I kept telling myself every time we got back to
          the 18th tee was `hit a shot, hit a shot'.</quote> 
        <p>A regular on the European PGA Tour, Fraser had about a 45-minute wait in the clubhouse
          after finishing his round. Pampling had a chance to win it outright on 18 but his 25-foot
          putt for birdie ended up inches short.</p>
        <p>Fraser had some anxious moments before the play-off started.</p>
        <p>His wife, Carlie, who is eight months pregnant, had to be taken to hospital for
          observation for the second time yesterday when she fell ill late in his round. Fraser said
          his wife had been to hospital earlier in the day as a precaution and returned there after
          play finished when she again showed signs of an early labour.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I just hope that she's all right and the baby's OK, that's the
          priority,</quote> Fraser said. <quote>Golf's not even in the picture.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Last year, Australia's Aaron Baddeley beat Sweden's Daniel Chopra with a par save on the
          fourth hole of a play-off at Huntingdale.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I got myself in position to score well on nearly every hole,</quote> Fraser
            said. <quote>It's the best I've played in a while.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Allenby shared the lead with fellow Australian Michael Sim, who shot a 77 and was seven
          strokes back. South African Tim Clark was among a group of three tied for fourth after a
          final-round 67, four shots behind. Clark was level with Nathan Green of Australia (70) and
          Alexander Noren, of Sweden, who shot 68.</p>

        <p>RUGBY UNION: Wallabies superstar Matt Giteau, 26, says he will spend the next fortnight
          deciding whether or not to seek a release from his Australian Rugby Union contract after
          receiving a staggering $10 million offer to play in France. Giteau broke his silence over
          his future playing intentions on Saturday, saying Bayonne's billionaire owner Alain
          Afflelou had tabled the offer during a meeting in Paris last week. ARU boss John O'Neill
          has ruled out granting him a short-term release from his contract, which expires after the
          2011 World Cup.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Allenby drained by emotion</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">MARK HAYES</byline>
        <p>THE world's best golfers have tried but they have never brought Robert Allenby to his
          knees like his ailing mother did yesterday.</p>
        <p>Allenby's tilt for a third Australian Masters title hung by an emotional thread for 14
          holes before Sylvia Allenby, understood to be in palliative care with advanced cancer,
          arrived - as planned - in a golf cart to watch him play the closing holes.</p>
        <p>It reduced the 37-year-old from steely, world-class golfer to humble, susceptible son
          whose quest to win one last trophy for his beloved mum had become a hurdle too high for
          even his genius to overcome.</p>
        <p>After seeing his mother, Allenby - revered as a brilliant bunker player - took three
          shots to escape the sand at the par-three 15th.</p>
        <p>His eyes glazed over and he momentarily stumbled to his knees as he climbed from the
          sand, knowing his title chances had gone, but also that something far more important in
          his life had understandably taken centre stage.</p>
        <p>Allenby then made his first putt of note all day, but the emotional tide had washed over
          him. He turned from the glare of the cameras to have a private moment, then after he teed
          off on the 16th, he staggered towards Sylvia and gave her a hug so meaningful that some
          who witnessed it were reduced to tears in sympathy.</p>
        <p>Later, putting on a brave face in his media conference, Allenby tried to use golf chatter
          to keep his thinly veiled feelings at bay.</p>
        <p>But even then, it became all too much for the 37-year-old who had been joint leader after
          the third round but faded to finish third with a one-over-par 73 .</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Obviously I'm pretty disappointed I didn't get myself to 12 under and give myself a
            chance to win in a play-off,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>Then, on 15, I just pretty much lost the plot,</quote> he said as his eyes glazed. </p>
         <quote>Um, I couldn't hold my emotions in any more . . .</quote>

          500m race in Beijing. The 23-year-old skated superbly in the final to disrupt a potential
          Chinese trifecta. Borodulina finished behind reigning World Cup champion Wang Meng, who
          broke her own world record, and Liu Qiuhong to claim the bronze and relegate Fu Tian Yu to

        <p>HARNESS Racing SA has announced prizemoney increases for the first time since the equine
          influenza outbreak in August last year.</p>
        <p>From January 1, five CO races a week will receive increased monies of $1000 per race.</p>
        <p>The additional cost to the budget will be approximately $125,000 to June 30, 2009.</p>
        <p>HRSA chairman Grant Goodall announced the increases are a direct result of State
          Government changes to the Authorised Betting Operations Act that will allow SA's three
          racing codes to save around $9 million per annum.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>That news has given the HRSA board confidence the leakage of funds to NSW racing
            codes will cease affecting our UNiTAB revenue,</quote> Goodall said. </p>
        <p>HRSA has also agreed - by a majority board decision - to accept recommendations looking
          into potential business mergers with the SA Harness Racing Club that operates Globe Derby
          Park.</p>
        <p>It adopted a motion that a joint management model - similar to that recently adopted by
          Queensland Harness Racing, where the controlling authority runs all harness club
          operations - be accepted as the model to be looked at for all SA clubs.</p>
        <p>Any formal adoption of the business model will require sign-off from club members and
          industry stakeholders.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>This is not a takeover model or threat to the club's assets,</quote> Goodall
            added. <quote>Some harness racing clubs struggle to manage aspects of their business and
            the new model addresses this.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>The formation of a joint committee between all parties to progress an agreed business
          case will be implemented.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>This direction will ensure the industry has the very best opportunity to expand and
            grow and, along with other initiatives currently on the drawing board, put SA harness
            racing back as leaders within five years,</quote> the chairman said. </p>
        <p>HRSA has been without a chief executive since August 2007 and is expecting to announce
          its new general manager before the end of this year.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Power-pack Royal clash</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">TONY REED, CHIEF RACING WRITER</byline>
        <p>ALTHOUGH taking different paths at the weekend Royal Ida and Amyjaye Power are set to
          clash in their coming two starts which culminates in the Christmas Handicap at Cheltenham
          on Boxing Day.</p>
        <p>The pair last met in the Listed Wylie Handicap (1100m) at Morphettville back on September
          13 - the most recent start for Royal Ida before he finished a 3 1/2-length fifth in the
          Allan Scott Park Handicap at headquarters on Saturday over the unsuitable 1050m sprint
          trip.</p>
        <p>Amyjaye Power was another three lengths behind Royal Ida in the Wylie in fourth position
          and had three more outings leading into last weekend's 1200m where he ran on late after
          being slowly away in the Aplus Handicap.</p>
        <p>They will meet in Saturday week's $70,000 City Of Marion Stakes (1200m) and Michael
          O'Leary, trainer of dual Christmas Handicap winner Royal Ida said the eight-year-old came
          through his first run from a let-up well.</p>
        <p>Stewards reported that the gelding suffered a lower than expected heart rate but the
          trainer said there is no cause of concern with the horse.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I thought he ran very well and wasn't beaten too far at all,</quote> he
            said. <quote>I would have been more worried if his heart rate was elevated because it
            would have meant the horse had over extended himself and been distressed.</quote> 
        </p>
         <quote>He'll be right for the City Of Marion and strip much fitter for the more suitable
          1450m of the Christmas Handicap.</quote> 
        <p>Gary Kennewell, the trainer of Amyjaye Power, was also pleased with that gelding's result
          after he missed the start.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>He was working home as strong as any other runner at the end and will run in a
            fortnight leading into the Christmas where he'll be better placed at the
            journey,</quote> he added. </p>
        <p>FORMER leading apprentice Ryan Plumb notched his first metropolitan winner as a senior
          jockey when $31 chance, Manila Jewel took out Hyundai Handicap for his recent ex-master
          David Hayes. He rode for the first time in senior ranks at Naracoorte on Friday and now
          plans to base himself at Morphettville. However, he'll still ride work at Lindsay Park for
          Hayes twice a week.</p>
        <p>DAMIEN Robinson has appealed to ride on a stay of proceedings following a five-week
          suspension imposed by TRSA stewards on Thursday over his handling of Tar A Bata at Murray
          Bridge on November 6.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Hong Kong guns on Apache Cat attack</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ADRIAN DUNN, MELBOURNE</byline>
        <p>AN ex-pat trainer, jockey and horse, all representing different interests, pose the
          greatest opposition to Apache Cat in Sunday week's Hong Kong Sprint.</p>
        <p>John Size, Brett Prebble and Green Birdie, formerly trained in Melbourne by Brian
          Jenkins, will form three of the main dangers to Apache Cat.</p>
        <p>While there is no Silent Witness or Sacred Kingdom, the Hong Kong sprinters still present
          formidable opposition.</p>
        <p>Enthused, a last-start winner of the Cathay Pacific International Sprint Trial, is
          trained by Size.</p>
        <p>With leading jockey Douglas Whyte to ride, Enthused is viewed as the likely favourite
          among the Hong Kong sprinters.</p>
        <p>Prebble rides Sunny Power, who was beaten a nose by Enthused in the Cathay Pacific
          International Sprint Trial.</p>
        <p>Green Birdie, a winner of the Sapphire Classic at Caulfield and runner-up behind Miss
          Andretti in the Schillaci Stakes, defeated Enthused when he won the Group 3 Premier Bowl
          (1200 m) in October.</p>
        <p>Trainer Greg Eurell acknowledges that Apache Cat will have to be at his best if he's to
          claim a seventh Group 1 in the Hong Kong Sprint.</p>
        <p>But, Eurell heads to Hong Kong with his confidence renewed after Apache Cat came within a
          nose of toppling Takeover Target in the Winterbottom Stakes (1200m) at Ascot on
          Saturday.</p>
        <p>Apache Cat flies back to Melbourne today before a 24-hour turnaround will see him fly to
          Hong Kong, via Singapore, tomorrow.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It was a big relief to see him come back and see him do as well as he did, but the
            disappointing thing was not to get the result after such a good run,</quote> Eurell
            said. <quote>But, it's no shame getting beaten by a horse (Takeover Target) of that
            calibre.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>
           <quote>More importantly, it gives us confidence to head across to Hong Kong. I think he
            will race very, very well there.</quote> Importantly, Apache Cat came out of the
          Winterbottom Stakes <quote>brilliantly</quote> according to Eurell, who added it was hard to
          detect the horse had raced. Eurell said he still could not explain Apache Cat's abject
          failure in the Patinack Stakes on the final day of the VRC carnival. </p>
        <p>He said the trip to Perth had mentally freshened Apache Cat, who responded in a manner
          that saw him crowned as Australia's champion sprinter last season.</p>
        <p>Eurell and jockey Corey Brown agree that had Apache Cat been able to gain a clear run
          before the 150m mark he would have won.</p>

        <p>With Blacks A Fake, the sport's all-conquering force of the past two years at the

        <p>In the wake of his Miracle Mile flop, Blacks A Fake has eased from $3.20 to $5 with

        <h property="dc:title">World Tennis Challenge Memorial Drive-January 14-16 MEMORIAL DRIVE
          Players retain their competitive edge Set for exciting clash</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">CANDICE KELLER</byline>
        <p>COMPETITION among the legends will be fierce at the inaugural World Tennis Challenge in
          January, tournament co-director Roger Rasheed says.</p>
        <p> Although the players are retired, Rasheed said many played international tennis
          full-time and were in <quote>fine form</quote> . </p>
        <p>Past champions Mats Wilander (Sweden), Pat Cash, Henri Leconte (France) and Jim Courier
          (U.S.), are recognised as being just as competitive now as they were during their reign,
          making for a tough tournament at Memorial Drive from January 14-16.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>These players are able to manage their bodies much more now than when they were
            playing the professional tour,</quote> Rasheed said. </p>
         <quote>They're in such good shape and still play in so many seniors and champions
          tournaments, it will surely make for a very energetic and exciting event.</quote> 
        <p>Rasheed said their continued involvement in the game meant rivalries would still run
          deep.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>The important thing for these guys is once you become an individual competitor, you
            never really lose that competitive nature,</quote> Rasheed said. </p>
         <quote>They've still got the hunger to win. It's almost like this is the second wind of
          their tennis careers.</quote> 
        <p>Australian tennis fans will particularly enjoy the meeting between Wilander and Cash -
          the two had many heated and arduous matches in the past on Australian soil.</p>
        <p>In 1988 Cash made the Australian Open final for the second consecutive year and made
          history as the first men's singles final to be played at the new Melbourne Park. However,
          the fairytale was not to be, Wilander shattering his dream in an epic four-and-a-half-hour
          battle, taking the fifth set 8-6.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>When you talk to these guys, they're still thinking about their current win-loss
            record,</quote> Rasheed said. </p>
        <p>Their present player counterparts - Joachim Johansson (Sweden), Mark Philippoussis, Gael
          Monfils (France) and Taylor Dent (U.S.) - will also put on a show for fans, Rasheed
          said.</p>
        <p>The game styles among the current players varies drastically. Philippoussis and Dent are
          widely recognised for their serve-volley games while Monfils and Johansson favour strength
          from the baseline.</p>
        <p>Yet each is expected to bring an exciting element to the round-robin competition.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Monfils is one of the new breed of players, who at 22 has enormous athletic
            potential and is amazing to watch in his own right,</quote> Rasheed, also Monfil's coach,
            said. <quote>The combination of players that we have signed for the tournament is
            excellent and offers great diversity.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>The non-ATP event is the brainchild of Courier, Mark Woodforde, Darren Cahill, Rasheed
          and Tennis SA boss Alistair MacDonald. It is the first of its kind worldwide.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">World Tennis Challenge Memorial Drive-January 14-16 LEGENDARY MOMENTS
          Cash in the top drawer</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">CANDICE KELLER</byline>
        <p>BRAZEN tennis champion Pat Cash is an unforgettable character of the sport.</p>
        <p>But it was not just his extroverted nature or trademark chequered headband that helped
          him to stand out from the rest.</p>
        <p>Cash broke down boundaries.</p>
        <p>It was in 1987 that Cash became Australia's tennis hero.</p>
        <p>On the esteemed grass courts of Wimbledon, Cash slowly gathered momentum toward a
          crescendo of glory - a coveted grand slam title.</p>
        <p>The road was rocky. He overpowered two champions of the era, Mats Wilander in the
          quarter-finals and Jimmy Connors in the semi-finals, to make it to the final.</p>
        <p>However, making it there was only half of the challenge. The final was to be a David and
          Goliath battle as Cash's opponent was then world No. 1 Ivan Lendl.</p>
        <p> The Czech player, known as <quote>Ivan the Terrible</quote> , was one of the game's most
          dominant players in the 1980s. He claimed eight grand slam titles from three different
          events between 1984 and 1990. Wimbledon was the only grand slam to escape him despite
          making the final twice. </p>
        <p>In 1987 it was Cash who stopped Lendl from achieving his dream, taking out the final in
          three sets; 7-6, 6-2, 7-5.</p>
        <p>It was after the final point was won that Cash made his mark on the sporting world by
          climbing into the stands and up to the player's box at Centre Court, where he celebrated
          with his family, girlfriend and coach. This started a Wimbledon tradition that has been
          followed by other champions.</p>
        <p>It was a drought-breaker. No Australian male had won a grand slam event since Mark
          Edmondson's Australian Open title in 1976, and the next came 10 years later when Pat
          Rafter won the U.S. Open in 1997-98.</p>
        <p>At the time Cash became Australia's highest-profile international sportsman.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>At the dinner I couldn't keep my eyes off the cup, which had my name engraved on it
            alongside all those other great players,</quote> Cash said. </p>
         <quote>It made me very, very proud. I don't know if I'm worthy of it. Suddenly I'm
          important. It's the one I always wanted.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">Spirit needs bodies</h>
        <p>SYDNEY coach Rob Beveridge has implored his players to stick with the NBL club until
          December 10 in the hope a white knight or two may charge to its rescue.</p>
        <p>The Spirit showed they still were willing despite their off-court woes in Saturday
          night's upset 103-94 home win over high-flying South.</p>
        <p> After a week of turmoil in which club owner Greg Evans was served a default notice, the
          Spirit scored a victory described by Beveridge as <quote>probably the best</quote> in his
          season-and-a-half in charge. Urged on by 2572 fans, their biggest crowd of the season, the
          Spirit put the dramas of the past week behind them. </p>
        <p>Spirit players have been asked to take a 50 per cent pay cut, while the league will prop
          up the club for the remainder of this season only, unless new investors can be found.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I've got to try and convince the players to hold out until December 10, that's when
            the league will officially take the licence back from Greg Evans,</quote> Beveridge said. </p>
        <p>Sydney beat the Dragons without import guard Derrick Low and big man Julian Khazzouh, who
          were prevented from playing by their agents, Beveridge revealing both had received
          European offers.</p>
        <p>Melbourne beat Perth 108-95 in Darwin without star Sam Mackinnon after he was diagnosed
          with blood clots in his lungs. Admitted to a Darwin hospital, his season - and possibly
          career - may be over.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Tigers challenge for Sixers to get it right</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">BOTI NAGY</byline>
        <p> SOMETIMES you have to <quote>win ugly</quote> and Adelaide had a few <quote>look away, I'm
            hideous</quote> moments in its hard-fought 101-96 success over Wollongong on Saturday. </p>
        <p>But it also had some sheer beauty and glorious harmony which should not be overlooked in
          the wash-up, especially with reigning NBL champion and 36ers' Public Enemy No. 1 Chris
          Anstey in town this week.</p>
        <p>Sixers coach Scott Ninnis looks like he has settled on a starting line-up of Aaron Bruce,
          Julius Hodge, Jacob Holmes, Adam Ballinger and Luke Schenscher. It was both terrible, and
          terrific.</p>
        <p>It started the game terribly, opening with a turnover, slipping behind 6-12 before Brett
          Maher's insertion turned the contest on its ear.</p>
        <p>But that very same quintet started the second half magnificently, jumping out 7-0 and
          from a 54-52 interval buffer to 67-55. Again when the Hawks threatened, Maher was in to
          jam them back in the nest with a triple, an assist and two free throw swishes.</p>
        <p>The starters get a passing grade, though the line-up with which the 36ers opened the
          second quarter, while clearly defence-oriented, seriously lacked offensive potency.</p>
        <p>Bruce (0-of-3, zero points), Brad Hill (0-of-2, zero points), Hodge (19 points, 11
          rebounds, six assists), Holmes (1-of-9, six points) and David Cooper (2- of-4, four
          points) was unable to retain the first quarter lead, slipping from 26-23 to 26-30.</p>
        <p>Again when ahead 76-65 deep in the third and with a rout looking possible, the player
          rotation was debatable.</p>
        <p> Holmes was visibly tired, Hill no match for Glen Saville and Cooper undoing his
          usefulness with a typically Cooperesque foul on <quote>Sav</quote> , a mere 1.4 seconds from
          the siren. </p>
        <p>That had the deficit back to a point, Wollongong in the midst of a 10-0 run which swept
          it ahead to 82-78 in the last and still 94-91 with 2:19 left. With 1:14 to go, the Hawks
          again led 96-95.</p>
        <p>With Hodge finishing strongly and exhorting the crowd, Ballinger important and Schenscher
          grabbing a big rebound and drawing a huge charge, Adelaide had enough things going well to
          keep alive its play-off drive.</p>
        <p>Ninnis interchanging Brad Davidson - who isn't seeing enough action but must still be
          envied by Paora Winitana - with Schenscher across the tense final 37 seconds was smart
          coaching.</p>
        <p> But he and his staff have to get it right against the Tigers, a team vulnerable right
          now but one which will never beat itself. Its MVP Anstey, who decked Maher in their
          previous clash when he was <quote>trying to hit Davidson</quote> will be playing his 300th
          NBL game. </p>
        <p>It is sure to be memorable.</p>

        <p>ADELAIDE Lightning wrenched back top place on the WNBL ladder in no uncertain manner on
          Friday but hanging on to it will be a challenge.</p>
        <p>Having reduced the Canberra Capitals to lower case with their irresistible 93-77 rout at
          the Dome on Friday, the reigning champion leapt back to the summit.</p>
        <p>But this week it faces the fifth-placed Rangers in Dandenong on Saturday night at 7.30,
          then faces up to fourth-ranked Bulleen at the Veneto Club at 2pm on Sunday. It is hardly
          much turnaround time.</p>
        <p>Bulleen also currently is the owner of the only blemish on Adelaide's 9-1 record, a loss
          the Lightning are keen to erase. But the draw does them no favours.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We just have to focus on Dandenong,</quote> Lightning coach Vicki Valk
            said. <quote>We've got a lot of improvement in us.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>That is a terrifying prospect for the rest of the WNBL considering how comprehensively
          Adelaide dismantled an experienced Canberra line-up which came to town in first place and
          on a six-win streak.</p>
        <p>With her 11-point, 16- rebound, 10-assist haul, it had Tracy Gahan producing only the
          16th triple-double in the WNBL's 28 years and historic first for the Lightning. It had
          Angela Marino playing 38 minutes, scoring 19 points at 56 per cent, with four assists, and
          leaving Nat Hurst in her wake.</p>
        <p>Cayla Francis fought hard for 19 points and nine boards despite foul troubles, Jess Foley
          cut loose for 17 second-half points, Rebecca Duke was effective all over the court and Mia
          Newley came in to provide an unexpected boost.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Different people popped up at different times,</quote> Valk said, reinforcing the
          depth of her quality team. </p>

        <byline property="dc:creator">CHRIS BARCLAY, LONDON</byline>
        <p>THE All Blacks have scaled another mini-Everest, completing New Zealand's third grand
          slam by effectively negating England's spoiling tactics at Twickenham yesterday.</p>
        <p>New Zealand won a niggardly season finale 32-6, a compelling final quarter blowing out
          the margin.</p>
        <p>The All Blacks' 13th win of a tough 15-Test season enabled them to join Graham Mourie's
          pioneering 1978 side and the 2005 tourists as conquerors of the four nations of the UK and
          Ireland.</p>
        <p>It also allowed the All Blacks to become the inaugural holders of the Hillary Shield -
          the new trophy conceived to commemorate legendary mountaineer Sir Edmund Hillary.</p>
        <p>Sir Edmund's widow Lady June presented Richie McCaw with the silver plate - a welcome
          addition to the honours cabinet which already includes the Bledisloe Cup and the
          Tri-Nations trophy.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Wallabies devastated by defeat</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">DARREN WALTON, CARDIFF</byline>
        <p>ROBBIE Deans presented a brave front but his vanquished Wallabies couldn't hide their
          anguish at ending their 2008 Test program with a loss at the hands of resurgent Wales at
          the Millennium Stadium yesterday.</p>
        <p>The shellshocked Wallabies slumped to a 21-18 defeat after failing to overcome the
          second-minute departure of talismanic captain Stirling Mortlock and another baffling
          display from Irish referee Alan Lewis.</p>
        <p>In a dramatic precursor to a brutal and gripping encounter, Mortlock was pole-axed in a
          sickening clash with Welsh centre Jamie Roberts, who played on unknowingly with a
          fractured skull for a further 15 minutes after the incident.</p>
        <p>Against the odds, the Wallabies somehow managed to stay in the contest until the final
          whistle despite battling all sorts of adversities, including injuries to several players
          now doubtful for the tour-ending tussle with the Barbarians at Wembley on Wednesday
          night.</p>
        <p>Under extreme pressure, Quade Cooper fared reasonably well out of position in the centres
          after covering for Mortlock, while Lote Tuqiri was magnificent in his first appearance all
          tour after replacing winger Peter Hynes, who was forced off on the half hour after being
          poked in the eye.</p>
        <p>But there were too many setbacks for the Wallabies to deal with and, ultimately, it was
          Lewis's refereeing that cost Australia the Test.</p>
        <p>On top of countless bewildering penalties going against Australia, Lewis missed several
          glaring forward passes from Wales, who notwithstanding played some inspired rugby.</p>
        <p>WALES 21 (Lee Byrne, Shane Williams tries; Stephen Jones con, 2 pens drop goal) d
          AUSTRALIA 18 (Mark Chisholm, Digby Ioane tries; Matt Giteau con, pen, drop goal) at

        <h property="dc:title">Celtic hailed</h>
        <p>CELTIC manager Gordon Strachan hailed his side as heroes for overcoming their European
          heartache with a 1-0 win over Inverness Caledonian Thistle on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The Parkhead club exited European competition on Tuesday following a 2-1 away defeat to
          Denmark's Aalborg in their Champions League Group E clash.</p>
        <p>But despite a poor performance against Inverness, the home side managed to grind out the
          win that puts them seven points clear in the race for the championship. And Strachan
          praised his players for the way they reacted to their midweek disappointment as his side
          won their 12th league game in a row.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>In the game against Inverness they have showed that when they are not at their best
            they are still able to get the win,</quote> Strachan said. </p>
         <quote>It shows they can deal with situations, they can deal with disappointments and at
          this moment in time the squad can deal with injuries.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">Loss puts Keane in the mire</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ROB HARRIS, MANCHESTER</byline>
        <p>BOLTON Wanderers rallied to beat Sunderland 4-1 yesterday and heap more pressure on
          manager Roy Keane as he took charge of the team for the 100th time.</p>
        <p>Johan Elmander scored twice for visitor Bolton, who also grabbed further goals from
          Matthew Taylor and Gary Cahill. Djibril Cisse netted for Sunderland.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It was very poor again. Individual mistakes have cost us for three of the four
            goals and obviously it is a very hard one to take again,</quote> Keane said. </p>
         <quote>We are giving teams a helping hand and maybe one or two players lost confidence in
          the second half.</quote> 
        <p>Cisse gave Sunderland a perfect start in the 11th minute, scoring off the post after
          being fed by Steed Malbranque, but Taylor rose above Pascal Chimbonda a few minutes later
          to meet Gretar Steinsson's cross with a looping header and equalise.</p>
        <p>Cahill put Bolton ahead in the 21st when Kevin Davies headed down Andy O'Brien's free
          kick, and then had referee Chris Foy to thank for keeping the lead intact. Kenwyne Jones
          headed off the crossbar and Cisse volleyed in the rebound, but Foy disallowed it, ruling
          that Jones had pushed Jlloyd Samuel.</p>
        <p>Slack defending from Danny Collins allowed Bolton to take a 3-1 lead when Elmander scored
          from a tight angle in the 39th minute.</p>
        <p>Elamander's second goal came in similar fashion in the 55th. Dean Whitehead stumbled over
          a clearance, allowing Kevin Nolan to feed the Sweden striker to complete a miserable day
          for Keane, whose side is 18th in the 20-team standings.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We are very concerned and as manager it's my job to put it right,</quote> Keane
          said. </p>
        <p>West Brom lost a fourth straight match 2-1 at Wigan despite Ishmael Miller scoring the
          club's first goal in 344 minutes in the 47th minute after Athletic defender Titus Bramble
          neglected to clear.</p>
        <p>West Brom's Paul Robinson failed to pick up Henri Camara's run and Emile Heskey was able
          to put the ball back into the striker's path to equalise in the 61st minute.</p>
        <p>With three minutes left, Emmerson Boyce scored Wigan's winner when he headed home a
          corner from substitute Jason Koumas.</p>
        <p>Newcomers Stoke and Hull played a 1-1 draw.</p>

        <p>MARK Viduka will not be rushed back into Newcastle United's starting line-up despite the
          striker making his long-awaited return from injury.</p>
        <p>Viduka twice nearly snatched a late winner in a 0-0 stalemate at his former club
          Middlesbrough, emerging unscathed as a second-half substitute in his first appearance for
          more than six months.</p>
        <p>Newcastle will not risk the 33-year-old Australian breaking down as he works his way back
          to full fitness after a career-threatening Achilles problem.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We know Mark's qualities as a player but he's not had so many minutes of match
            play,</quote> assistant coach Chris Hughton said. </p>
         <quote>He's available and has done a fair amount of training but he just hasn't had the
          match play.</quote> 
         <quote>For us the most important thing now is to get him to a fitness level.</quote> 
        <p>Despite an understandable lack of match sharpness, Viduka was only denied a match-winning
          contribution by David Wheater's desperate point-blank block, before Ross Turnbull kept out
          an injury-time effort.</p>
        <p>In another goalless stalemate, Socceroos 'keeper Mark Schwarzer was forced to make some
          top-class clearances under pressure to help Fulham hold Aston Villa 0-0 at Villa Park.</p>
        <p>The Australian also enjoyed a stroke of luck when Gareth Barry's close-range header met
          his outstretched hands and bounced up to clip the crossbar.</p>

        <p>Adelaide's Sharon Black missed a chance to equalise from the penalty spot in the 41st
          minute after Kuralay had opened the scoring. Melbourne's Daniela Di Giammarco's headed

        <h property="dc:title">Reds confront Kiwi foes</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">VAL MIGLIACCIO</byline>
        <p>ADELAIDE United faces a case of double jeopardy within six days as it prepares to meet
          the Kiwis.</p>
        <p>Adelaide takes on in-form A-League side Wellington Phoenix on Friday night at Hindmarsh
          before leaving for Tokyo the following day for the clash with Waitakere United in the FIFA
          Club World Cup quarter-final play-offs on December 11.</p>
        <p>Wellington is looming as a massive test for the Reds before the Japan trek after Shane
          Smeltz scored a screamer in the 2-1 home win over Melbourne Victory for the Phoenix on
          Friday.</p>
        <p>The former Adelaide United and Adelaide City striker is the league's hottest striker with
          nine goals.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Sydney FC's fans turned on the Bling during its 1-1 draw with Queensland Roar
          at the Sydney Football Stadium on Friday night.</p>
        <p>Sydney's fans booed the team at half-time after Roar's Matt McKay scored in the 12th
          minute.</p>
        <p>Sydney's smallest-ever crowd of 8502 weren't happy with the performance but coach John
          Kosmina responded to the fans' discord after the game.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I actually said to them at half-time, go and stick it up the crowd,</quote> Kosmina
          said. </p>
         <quote>It was as simple as that.</quote> 
        <p>Sydney's woes, however, are set to be compounded with Frank Lowy understood to be selling
          his majority share of the club.</p>
        <p>It's believed the Football Federation Australia chairman came to Sydney's financial
          rescue in season two.</p>
        <p> Central Coast Mariners again played the <quote>get out of jail card</quote> in a 2-2 draw
          with Perth Glory at Members Equity Stadium on Saturday night. </p>
        <p>Mariners striker Sasho Petrovski broke Glory's hearts with just seconds to go when he
          drilled home the equaliser.</p>
        <p>The Mariners have made a habit of great escapes this season. Its first Houdini act
          arrived in Adelaide in October when the Mariners pegged back a three-goal deficit to level
          the game 3-3 at Hindmarsh Stadium.</p>
        <p>Sydney FC copped the same fate last month.</p>

        <p>ADELAIDE United's Baby Reds crushed Newcastle Jets 3-0 in the curtainraiser at
          EnergyAustralia Stadium yesterday.</p>
        <p>The Baby Reds were bolstered by the presence of Robert Cornthwaite, who was left out of
          the senior squad for the second week in succession.</p>
        <p>Adelaide jumped into second spot, seven points behind leader Sydney FC. The convincing
          win was kick-started by former senior Reds striker Matthew Mullen's 40th-minute goal.
          Francesco Monterosso and Shane Tobias completed the rout.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Sasa the saviour after late strike</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">VAL MIGLIACCIO</byline>
        <p>ADELAIDE United boss Aurelio Vidmar complained his side was not savage enough in front of
          goal after Herculean defender Sasa Ognenovski saved the Reds from a calamitous defeat last
          night.</p>
        <p>Ognenovski scored in the fifth minute of stoppage time to salvage a 1-1 draw with
          Newcastle Jets at EnergyAustralia Stadium.</p>
        <p>Adelaide failed to make the most of a depleted Jets line-up, who were minus suspended key
          players Joel Griffiths and Mark Milligan.</p>
        <p>But Ognenovski's headed goal handed United an unlikely escape after Adelaide failed to
          put the Jets away despite the numerous chances throughout the second half.</p>
        <p>It was Ognenovski's second headed goal in as many weeks after the tough defender scored
          Adelaide's first goal in a 2-0 home win over Sydney FC nine days ago.</p>
        <p>And United was lucky to grab a draw considering the fourth official displayed three
          minutes of stoppage time.</p>
        <p>Yet referee Chris Beath allowed the crucial extra seconds for Ognenovski's equaliser.</p>
        <p>Adelaide, which was vying for equal top position with Melbourne Victory before the clash,
          was almost reduced to pedestrian status in a forgettable performance.</p>
        <p>Adelaide maintained second spot but Vidmar said the Reds had ditched two points after a
          lacklustre performance in front of goal.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I'm disappointed,</quote> Vidmar said. </p>
         <quote>They were there for the taking.</quote> 
         <quote>We had so much possession but we couldn't do anything with the ball in that front
          third of the pitch.</quote> 
         <quote>We're not savage or ruthless enough in front of goal and in the end we got a little
          bit of luck to get the point.</quote> 
         <quote>It's not a wake-up call for us but if you can't score goals you don't win games -
          simple.</quote> 
         <quote>Our endeavour was good but the finishing not so good.</quote> 
        <p>Ognenovski echoed Vidmar's sentiment. He said Adelaide was frustrating throughout the
          clash after dominating for long periods.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We're just not aggressive enough in front of goal,</quote> Ognenovski said. </p>
         <quote>We need to improve, it would have been unfair to escape with nothing but at the same
          time we've got some work to do.</quote> 
         <quote>We lack the killer instinct inside the box.</quote> 
        <p>The Jets took Adelaide to task with a goal in the 56th minute after complacency set
          in.</p>
        <p>Defender Angelo Costanzo was uncharacteristically too casual before a backheel went
          horribly wrong.</p>
        <p>Jason Naidovski stole the ball from Costanzo's feet before squaring it to Matt Thompson,
          who smashed the gift off the post and into the back of the net from 10 metres.</p>
        <p>The Jets' goal failed to spark Adelaide into life until Vidmar introduced Cristiano and
          Jason Spagnuolo from the bench in the 74th minute.</p>
        <p>Adelaide's Travis Dodd had a golden opportunity to equalise in the 86th minute when a
          Kristian Sarkies' accurate ball put the skipper through but he was thwarted by the
          desperation of keeper Ante Covic - twice - with the goal at his mercy.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Port pulls off the big steal Power hits the draft jackpot</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ANDREW CAPEL</byline>
        <p>IT was the draft day steal - with one proviso.</p>
        <p>That Jackson Trengove's suspect right leg can stand up to the rigours of AFL
          football.</p>
        <p> Port Adelaide's remarkable capture of the highly-rated Victorian big man at pick 22 was
          seen as the draft's biggest coup, along with the Brisbane Lions' <quote>theft</quote> of
          Daniel Rich - once considered a possible No. 1 pick - at No. 7. </p>
        <p>The Power's hometown rival Adelaide was linked with the supremely-athletic Trengove at
          pick No. 10 but revealed it baulked at selecting him because of concerns over a
          knee/hamstring injury he suffered mid-year.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We did our due diligence on Jackson,</quote> Rendell said. <quote>It (his injury) was
            a bit of an issue, not a bit of an issue, a real issue. We were assured by a neurologist
            that he would be okay in time and even our people thought he would probably be okay in
            time.</quote> 
        </p>
         <quote>But they couldn't guarantee it, that's probably why he dropped down to Port's pick.
          But they might have got a very, very good player at pick 22.</quote> 
        <p>Trengove, 18, was considered a top-10 selection, possibly top-five pick, until he had
          complications with surgery in June to re-attach his hamstring tendon, which had torn off
          the fibula bone while training for Vic Metro.</p>
        <p>A nerve problem meant Trengove struggled with movement in his foot and needed further
          surgery in July. This scared clubs off the 196cm key-position giant, despite nerve
          specialist Richard Gerraty last week giving the Calder Cannons product the medical
          all-clear.</p>
        <p>But Port wasn't to be scared. When Trengove was still on the draft board at 22 it had
          little hesitation in picking him.</p>
        <p> National recruiting manager Blair Hartley described Trengove's selection as <quote>a
            calculated risk, but one we had to take</quote> . </p>
        <p>
           <quote>He was too good a player to slip through and, to be honest, we were over the moon
            when he was still available to us,</quote> Hartley said. <quote>If you had asked me a week
            ago if I'd thought Jackson would be available at 22, I would have said `no way'.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Hartley had been eyeing Trengove for a year, saying after Port's record 2007 grand final
          loss to Geelong he worked out a possible top-10 for this year's national draft.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I was just trying to get an idea of where we could go and I had Hamish Hartlett
            (Port's first selection at No. 4) and Jackson inside the top 10,</quote> he
            said. <quote>To get them both a year later is a great result for us.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Hartley said the Power had done its homework on Trengove and believes he will regain full
          fitness.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Our doctor (Peter Barnes) has done extensive testing of Jackson and we're confident
            that there will be no long-lasting effects and he'll be fully fit and ready to go next
            year,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>A former team-mate of Power-listed Mitch Farmer at Calder, Trengove arrives in Adelaide
          from Melbourne this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Describing himself as a centre half-back who can pinch-hit in the ruck, Trengove - whose
          20-year-old sister is a black belt in karate - said he was slowly getting over his
          injuries.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I've still got a little bit of a drop in my big toe (from the nerve damage) but
            that doesn't really affect me kicking the football or running and it's supposed to come
            good before Christmas,</quote> he said. </p>
         <quote>It's a bit hard with nerves to work out when it's going to come good completely but
          it's improving every day so soon enough I'll be out there and be 100 per cent.</quote>

          of the more highly-rated Cyril Rioli (selection 12, Hawthorn) and Brad Ebert (13, West
          Coast).</p>
        <p>This year they pulled off another surprise by selecting North Adelaide key position
          player Davis at No. 10 ahead of more high-profile, 10-goal TAC Cup grand final hero Steele
          Sidebottom (pick 11, Collingwood) and athletic tall Jackson Trengove (22, Port
          Adelaide).</p>
        <p>Ruckman/forward Shaun McKernan, who ended up at the Crows at pick 28, also was rated
          higher than Davis on many draft boards.</p>
        <p>Davis hadn't been expected to be taken until pick 16 by premier Hawthorn but Rendell
          wasn't prepared to let him slip that far.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We thought Davis was an absolute no-brainer from go to whoa,</quote> Rendell said,
          revealing he ranked all of Adelaide's five draft picks - Davis, McKernan, Rory Sloane,
          Thomas Lee and Will Young - inside his top-20. </p>
        <p>Rendell surprisingly went as far as to say that on a needs basis, the Crows had ranked
          Davis No. 2 on their draft board behind overall No. 1 pick Jack Watts, who was selected by
          Melbourne.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>If Jack Watts was still there (at pick 10) we would have taken him,</quote> Rendell
            said. <quote>Otherwise it was Davis.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> Rendell said he had earmarked Davis as his man a year ago. <quote>Six-foot-fivers from
            your home town who can play just about any position on the ground are hard to knock
            back,</quote> Rendell said. </p>
         <quote>And (he's) really competitive. We were always going with Davis.</quote> 
        <p>Rendell believes Davis only slipped as far as 10 because of a shoulder injury he suffered
          this year which restricted him to only four games in the lower levels with the
          Roosters.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>To tell you the truth, and he probably won't mind me saying this, we were rapt when
            he did his shoulder (mid-season),</quote> Rendell said. <quote>It hid him off the radar
            from a lot of clubs. I know a lot of clubs will probably say they didn't see enough of
            him but we saw enough.</quote> 
        </p>
         <quote>He can be a standout in defence, in a couple of reserves games he played forward and
          kicked a couple of bags of goals which showed us he could do that as well, and he can play
          in the midfield.</quote> 
         <quote>We look for big blokes who can be versatile. We love his competitiveness, the way he
          reads the play and his use of the ball.</quote> 
         <quote>He's a fantastic kid. He's a leader and he's got a bit of an aggressive streak in
          him, which is fantastic for a kid of his size.</quote> 
        <p>The Crows' other selection, Victorian Sloane, is a 182cm midfielder who can play just
          about anywhere.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Footy attack style dazzles the Crows</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ANDREW CAPEL</byline>
        <p>FIRST Taylor Walker, now Shaun McKernan.</p>
        <p>In drafting Calder Cannons ruckman/forward McKernan with pick 28 at Saturday's national
          draft, the Crows have another excitement machine they are banking on to light up their
          forward line and bring fans through the turnstiles.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I like to launch myself at the footy,</quote> McKernan said on arrival in Adelaide
          last night when he offered an exciting glimpse into his game. <quote>I like to attack the
            footy, jumping and marking is my go.</quote> That is music to the ears of Crows fans who
          already are licking their lips in anticipation of what second-year forward Walker might
          offer next season. </p>
        <p> Like his older brother Corey - a North Melbourne star and dual premiership player -
          Shaun is a Jumping Jack Flash. <quote>Our supporters will love his competitiveness, the way
            he plays,</quote> recruiting manager Matthew Rendell said. </p>
         <quote>Obviously he's still got a lot to learn but he has a crack, he keeps his eyes on the
          ball and is strong in the air, he's very athletic and he's a great mover.</quote> 
        <p>Rendell could not believe his luck when McKernan was still on the draft board at pick 28.
          He had been talked about as a top-15 selection.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Yeah, I was shocked, so we were very happy to get him,</quote> he said. McKernan -
          an All-Australian under-18 this year - has played mainly as a ruckman in juniors but the
          Crows view him as a key position player. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>He's very capable of playing as a key forward or key back,</quote> Rendell
            said. <quote>I saw him kick four goals in 10 minutes as a 17-year-old and this season saw
            him get 28 possessions at centre half-back, so he's got some versatility about
            him.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Rendell, who said McKernan's kicking style was unusual but effective, said he was the
          most likely of the Crows' five draftees to play AFL next season.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>Of all of our players he's the one likely to jump up and play because he's
            physically very well built (196cm, 94kg),</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>McKernan, who is 17 years younger than Corey, said he aspired to be like his brother.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>He was my inspiration growing up,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p> As for moving to Adelaide, Shaun said he had no qualms. <quote>Adelaide is a great club,
            well coached and on the rise,</quote> he said. <quote>I'm thrilled to have the opportunity
            to play here.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">Symonds may have to dodge another bullet</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">RICHARD EARLE</byline>
        <p>ANDREW Symonds' week from hell deteriorated further yesterday with a dubious decision
          conspiring to jeopardise his Test spot.</p>
        <p>Allrounder Symonds, 33, endured a torrent of controversy and speculation over his playing
          future due to an incident at a Brisbane hotel following Australia's 149-run first Test win
          last week. Now, the spotlight is on Symonds' form following an unlucky caught behind
          dismissal without scoring yesterday. It extended a lean summer for the Queenslander.</p>
        <p>Symonds' Bulls team-mate Shane Watson yesterday staked a timely claim for a recall in the
          first Test against South Africa this month in Perth. Allrounder Watson stormed to his best
          first-class figures of 7/69 against South Australia at the Gabba yesterday. He then
          blasted 81 from 83 balls to lead a Bulls fightback after they missed first-innings
          points.</p>
        <p>Umpire Billy Doctrove sent 23-Test veteran Symonds on his way despite appearing to flick
          his pad with his bat to a delivery from Black Caps paceman Chris Martin. The bad boy who
          once said he was without a map when batting early in his career now faces a pressing
          battle to find direction and runs.</p>
        <p>Symonds' reaction to his demise yesterday had all the hallmarks of a man under
          pressure.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I'd trust his reactions with the week he's had. That is a genuine
          reaction,</quote> said former Australian keeper, now Channel Nine commentator Ian Healy
          analysing a shake of the head by disappointed Symonds on exit. Symonds has made 46 runs at
          15.3 in three innings and taken one wicket this series against the Black Caps. There have
          also been slim pickings at Sheffield Shield level with the willow - Symonds has scored
          just 80 runs in six innings at 13.3 for the Bulls this season. </p>
        <p>Dashing allrounder Watson lost his position to Symonds but issued a bold counter-claim
          for Test selection in eclipsing his best figures of 6/32 for Tasmania against the Bulls at
          Hobart in 2001-02.</p>
        <p>Symonds was cleared of any wrongdoing by Cricket Australia following the incident at
          Brisbane's Normanby Hotel but it affected team preparations in the lead-up to the Test.
          The next bullet Roy might have to dodge is at the selection table.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Yes, there is life after Gilchrist</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">BEN DORRIES</byline>
        <p>BOY from Gundagai Brad Haddin revealed the bliss of finally feeling like he belonged in a
          baggy green cap as he waltzed into cricket folklore at Adelaide Oval.</p>
        <p>Haddin (169) blazed the highest Test score by a wicketkeeper on Australian soil and the
          second-highest by an Australian behind Adam Gilchrist's unbeaten 204 in Johannesburg in
          2002.</p>
        <p>He and Michael Clarke (110) scorched a 181-run partnership to torment New Zealand with
          Haddin riding his luck to show Australia there is life after wicketkeeping legend
          Gilchrist.</p>
        <p>Rampaging Australia was finally bowled out for 535 and the Kiwis were 0/35 at stumps on
          the third day of the second Test, still 230 runs from making Australia bat again.</p>
        <p>Vice-captain Clarke, now recovered from the illness which stripped him of five kilograms
          in India, re-enforced his reputation as a flat track batting bully with his third
          consecutive Adelaide Test ton.</p>
        <p>But the day belonged to Haddin, the affable keeper-batsman who grew up alongside the
          Murrumbidgee River in country NSW.</p>
        <p>Haddin is now officially more famous than Gundagai's other well-known resident - the
          drover's dog that in mythical legend loyally guarded a man's tuckerbox until death.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I'm just starting to feel like I belong as the Australian
          wicketkeeper,</quote> Haddin said. </p>
         <quote>At the Gabba (in the first Test) I was just starting to be myself and enjoy
          myself.</quote> 
        <p>The 31-year-old's first Test century and highest first-class score released the pressure
          he was under for an inauspicious start to his Test career where he struggled for runs and
          fumbled catches.</p>
        <p>But Haddin - who played through the pain of a broken finger in his debut series in the
          West Indies - silenced his critics. It has taken nine Tests to score his first Test
          century but the moment was sweet when he waved his arms like a windmill in an exuberant
          celebration.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It was a pretty emotional time,</quote> Haddin said. </p>
         <quote>I have played first-class cricket now for 10 years. I know it's a bit of a cliche but
          you dream of those days of scoring 100 for Australia.</quote> 
        <p>Clarke said the day was special primarily because of Haddin's history-making run
          blitz.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>After the tough run in India he copped a bit of criticism,</quote> Clarke said. </p>
         <quote>Today is going to be the start of his long Test career.</quote> 
        <p>It came on a day when hapless New Zealand was under scrutiny for negative tactics, which
          included wicketkeeper Brendon McCullum sometimes crouching outside leg-stump to
          spinners.</p>
        <p>Haddin's breakthrough century, coming in his ninth Test, was a wonderful achievement
          considering wicketkeeping icon Ian Healy took 48 Tests to score his first century and Rod
          Marsh took 12.</p>
        <p>Healy's greatest Test knock - his famous 161 against the West Indies at the Gabba in
          1996-97 - was the highest by a wicketkeeper on Australian soil until Haddin surged past
          the mark yesterday. Healy, commentating on Channel Nine, backed Haddin to be Australia's
          long-term gloveman.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>He'll get there. He's had to fight so much this year,</quote> Healy said. <quote>He's
            coming through the other end.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>Gilchrist said Haddin's breakthrough century was a pressure reliever for the man who
          sometimes became so nervous he was physically ill before he batted.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>He is a nervous guy . . . with this hundred what he is going to do is grow in
            confidence,</quote> Gilchrist said. </p>
        <p>Haddin made his debonair century in just 133 balls but never should have got to
          triple-figures when he was dropped on 72 with Daniel Flynn spilling a sitter at mid-on.
          The Black Caps also believed they had Haddin glancing a hook behind, on seven, but umpire
          Billy Doctrove ruled not out and replays were inconclusive. On 102, Haddin also appeared
          to edge a ball onto his body but was again ruled not out when the catch was taken at
          short-leg off the bowling of Daniel Vettori.</p>
        <p>The day was also one to cherish for Clarke who enjoyed his ninth Test century.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">Our D-day, declares Sorell</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ANDREW CAPEL</byline>
        <p>COACH Mark Sorell has described today as the most crucial day's play of the season for
          South Australia as it chases its first Sheffield Shield win in a year.</p>
        <p> Trailing by 312 runs with one Queensland wicket to take, the Redbacks will take
            an <quote>all-or-nothing</quote> approach to victory in an attempt to add another four
          points to the two first-innings points they already have secured. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>We'll be going for the six points, no doubt about that,</quote> Sorell said after
          watching his side yesterday again let the Bulls off the hook at the Gabba - the scene of
          SA's last outright win in December last year. <quote>If we can get a quick wicket and chase
            320 or thereabouts I'm sure it's a target we can get.</quote> 
        </p>
         <quote>The wicket's still good and the way the game has gone it (the victory target) will be
          the lowest innings total so we'll certainly have a crack at it.</quote> 
         <quote>It's been the sort of wicket where there's been four-to-four-and-a-half runs scored
          per over so if we bat well it's more than a gettable score.</quote> 
         <quote>But as I said, we do have to get that early wicket.</quote> 
        <p> Sorell said the Redbacks - who had centuries from Pakistan's Younus Khan and Callum
          Ferguson in the first innings - were in a position where they had to <quote>go for
            it</quote> . </p>
        <p>
           <quote>We need the points so it's a really big day for us,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>The Redbacks appeared to be right on top of Queensland several times yesterday but - as
          has become far too familiar - couldn't finish the job.</p>
        <p>Starting the day trailing the Bulls by just four runs at 4/348, SA lost 6/63 as Test
          discard Shane Watson tore through the batting, claiming a career-best 7/69 to leave the
          Redbacks with a slender 59-run lead.</p>
        <p>Watson then capped a stunning allround display for Queensland by scoring a rapid 81 off
          83 balls to help the Bulls to 9/371 at stumps, giving them an overall lead of 312.</p>
        <p>Wicketkeeper Chris Hartley (71 not out) and former Redbacks quick Ryan Harris (46) set up
          an intriguing last day's play with a 95-run ninth-wicket stand after the home side had
          slumped to 8/240 following some excellent bowling from Dan Christian (4/89). But Harris -
          who hurt his former team by making 51 in the first innings - again stood firm, joining
          Hartley for an entertaining stand.</p>
        <p>The day featured a remarkable 15 wickets and 434 runs.</p>

        <h property="dc:title">CHANCES REMOTE Cousins on the outer Hoping for backflip</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">JON RALPH, MELBOURNE</byline>
        <p>BEN Cousins' manager Ricky Nixon admits the star midfielder's chances of extending his
          career are remote and will depend on a last-minute backflip from an AFL club.</p>
        <p>Nixon yesterday hit out at Brisbane for the timing of its rejection of Cousins on the eve
          of the draft and denied he had deliberately dodged a hair test. He said several clubs
          approached him on draft day revealing their distaste at how Cousins had been shunned by
          the AFL community.</p>
        <p> But Nixon knows with 16 clubs already publicly ruling out taking Cousins, he may have
          run out of options. Cousins was player No. 209448 at the draft but was overlooked despite
          four recycled players being given new homes. <quote>Clubs will assess what they have got
            (at the draft). They all have wants and needs. And there will be some club sitting there
            saying, `We didn't get the quick midfielder with a bit of experience we wanted late in
            the draft. That would be a bit of hope there for him,</quote> Nixon said. </p>
        <p>While six clubs officially have selections in the pre-season draft on December 16, that
          could change in coming weeks. In order, Melbourne, Port Adelaide, Essendon, Carlton,
          Brisbane and Richmond have selections but there is a third list lodgement this Wednesday.
          That means clubs could delist an uncontracted player by then to create room for a
          pre-season pick.</p>
        <p>But clubs also have to lodge their player payment estimates by then, with the AFL to
          inform them in the days before the pre-season draft if they can take part.</p>
        <p>So conceivably any of those six clubs could be ruled out of the pre-season draft by lack
          of salary cap space.</p>
        <p> Nixon said: <quote>The positive thing is at the draft a number of clubs said, `We have
            got to do something about this situation. It is not good, it's ugly. He is a champion of
            our game and we have to look after him.'</quote> 
        </p>
        <p>There was speculation on draft day Port Adelaide coach Mark Williams might pull a
          left-field selection and recruit Cousins but he was emphatic.</p>
         <quote>No, we weren't picking Ben and certainly to live in Adelaide is not good (for him).
          It's a small town.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">New Crows hit the heights</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">ANDREW CAPEL</byline>
        <p>ADELAIDE coach Neil Craig has hailed his club's new draftees, saying the club has finally
          addressed its key position needs.</p>
        <p>In securing four talls among their five selections at the AFL national draft, the Crows
          have gone from small fry to the land of the giants.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It's a bit like that,</quote> Craig said as he joined captain Simon Goodwin and some
          of his players in welcoming the club's latest batch of teenagers at Adelaide Airport last
          night. </p>
         <quote>The number of tall, quality players in this year's draft was as good as it's been in
          my time at the club and we all know what the draft's going to look like in the next few
          years with two new teams coming in, so it was important for us to seize the opportunity
          and I thought we did that.</quote> 
        <p>Adelaide nailed key position prospects Phil Davis, Shaun McKernan, Thomas Lee and Will
          Young as well as midfielder Rory Sloane.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>We want to keep servicing our forward line and with Davis and McKernan in
            particular we feel we've done that,</quote> Craig said. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>Key forwards have been a bit of an issue for us so I'm sure our supporters will be
            glad to hear that we've got some young forwards who can hopefully grow into those
            positions.</quote> While first-round pick Davis has played more in defence than attack,
          Craig believes he will develop into a strong-marking forward. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>Most of the vision I saw of Davis was playing up forward, so that's what I've
            certainly got in my head,</quote> he said. <quote>We've got some good young ruckmen in
            (Brad) Moran, (Kurt) Tippett, (Jonathon) Griffin and (Ivan) Maric and now with Tippett,
            (Taylor) Walker, (Trent) Hentschel and the new younger kids, while it's not an overnight
            fix - the proof will be when the games start - at least they are now in our system,
            which is pretty exciting for us.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">Scaife faces ruin</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">JAMES PHELPS, SYDNEY</byline>
        <p>AUSTRALIAN motor racing legend Mark Skaife is facing financial ruin and living in a
          rented three-bedroom flat with his wife and two daughters less than 1km away from his
          former Toorak mansion.</p>
        <p>In one of the saddest stories in Australian sport, the five-time Bathurst winner will
          walk away from his glittering 21-year touring car career at Oran Park this weekend in
          danger of losing his business empire.</p>
        <p>A special investigation by The Advertiser has uncovered details of a series of business
          transactions that have left Skaife's company - Skaife Sports - owing Scottish racing
          magnate Tom Walkinshaw $3.6 million.</p>
        <p>Had he not faced such immense business debts as owner of Holden Racing Team (HRT) he may
          not have quit as a driver at the age of 42.</p>
        <p>Documents obtained from the Australian Security and Investments Commission (ASIC) reveal
          the Holden icon risks losing all his Skaife Sports assets, including one of the country's
          greatest sporting brands HRT, should he default on the multi-million dollar loan to
          Walkinshaw.</p>
        <p>Skaife, who won his first Bathurst in 1991, rose rapidly to the peak of the sport in
          Australia.</p>
        <p>Enormously popular with fans and sponsors, the Melbourne-born driver is known for his
          aggression on the track and his outspoken attitude off it.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It's a sad situation,</quote> a source close to Skaife said. <quote>He doesn't
            deserve this.</quote>

        <h property="dc:title">CUP HOST MOVE Australia in the mix</h>
        <byline property="dc:creator">JON PIERIK</byline>
        <p>CRICKET'S sub-continent crisis was laid bare last night when it emerged Australia and New
          Zealand could host the next World Cup.</p>
        <p>World hot spots India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh are scheduled to stage
          cricket's marquee tournament in February and March of 2011.</p>
        <p>But a meeting of International Cricket Council chief executives in South Africa next
          weekend is set to discuss putting another country on standby or shifting the event to curb
          the constant speculation over player safety which had led to the mini World Cup, the
          Champions Trophy, being cancelled in strife-torn Pakistan this year.</p>
        <p>Australia and New Zealand will host the World Cup in 2015 but there is a possibility it
          could be held on local shores earlier than expected.</p>
        <p> CA chief executive James Sutherland said safety and security issues surrounding the 2011
          World Cup were <quote>bound to come up</quote> next weekend. </p>
        <p>
           <quote>It hasn't been talked about but that may well have changed out of this Mumbai
            incident. But one would hope the World Cup and other events that are planned for various
            places in the sub-continent can go ahead as planned,</quote> he said. </p>
         <quote>But there will be plenty of things that will need to be planned in the fullness of
          time.</quote> 
        <p>New Zealand and Australia staged the 1992 World Cup with Pakistan defeating England in
          the final at the MCG.</p>
        <p>Australia was put on standby to host the 2007 World Cup when it appeared the West Indies
          were labouring in their attempts to have new stadiums and general infrastructure built on
          time.</p>

        <p>Sutherland said he did not know if another country had already been put on standby for
          the 2011 tournament and was non-committal when asked if Australia would have enough time
          to prepare for the event if it was switched.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>I don't know the answer to that. It's something that down the track would need to
            be looked at but we are very keen for it to go ahead where it has already been
            allocated,</quote> he said. <quote>Let's see how things settle down after the tragic
            events of Mumbai.</quote> 
        </p>
        <p> ICC spokesman James Fitzgerald said there had yet to be any discussions about shifting
          the tournament. <quote>A decision would have to be made soon if that was to happen because
            we need a good run in to get the World Cup ready on time,</quote> he said. </p>
        <p>An Australian team source said if the bloodshed and political uncertainty continued in
          the four cricketing nations players may be loathe to make the trip.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>The World Cup isn't that far off. Will things settle down by then? I don't
            know,</quote> he said. </p>
         <quote>It's a tricky one right now. Hopefully it can be played there but who knows?</quote> 
        <p>Several tours of Pakistan have been cancelled for security reasons while Federal
          Government advice encourages Australians to avoid Sri Lanka (civil war) and Bangladesh
          (general trouble).</p>
        <p>These countries are all but certain to resist any attempt to shift the billion-dollar
          tournament, even though they were criticised by the ICC for being 10 months behind in
          preparations.</p>
        <p>That they form the backbone of the Asian bloc which holds the balance of power around the
          ICC board table means ripping the event from their hands will be a tough task.</p>
        <p>Former Australian captain Greg Chappell said the Mumbai terror rampage will now change
          the players' perspective on India.</p>
        <p>
           <quote>It will have a profound effect, I think, on cricket and where and how tournaments
            are conducted in the future, so it's going to be a challenging time for everybody
            involved,</quote> Chappell said. </p>
         <quote>A lot of people will be giving some thought about how to progress from here and I
          would think most players will wait and see but it's changed the landscape irrevocably now
          - players will look at India differently now than they have in the past.</quote>

        <p>Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin finally confirmed his ability with the bat yesterday.
          With help from fellow centurian Michael Clarke, Haddin belted a superb 169 to put
          Australian into a strong position on the third day of the second Test against New Zealand
          at Adelaide Oval.</p>
