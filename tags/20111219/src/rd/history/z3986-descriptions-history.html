            <h2>Version 1.0 (2012-12-19)</h2>
            <p>First public release.</p>
            <p>This release incorporates the following changes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>the profile has been updated to comply to the RDFa 1.1 Core October 20, 2012 Editor's Draft:
                    <ul>
                        <li>the default RDFa profile has been renamed the initial context document;</li>
                        <li>context documents are now located in the <code>/context</code> subdirectory of <code>/vocab</code> (previously they were in <code>/profiles</code>);</li>
                        <li>the <code>profile</code> attribute has been removed and replaced by a <code>meta</code> element for declaring the initial context document URI;</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>a special RDFa processing context has also been included for elements that represent self-contained documents (i.e., that have a metadata and body container). Metadata expressed without an <code>about</code> attribute now applies to the nearest container element. An implicit <code>about</code> attribute association is made between the <code>meta</code> element and the cotainer element.</li>
                <li>the <code>ref</code> and <code>xlink:href</code> attributes have been added to the <code>quote</code> element to allow a citation to be directly referenced;</li>
                <li>the <code>address</code> element has been added for physical and virtual addresses;</li>
                <li>a Phrase variant of the <code>note</code> element was added to allow notes and annotations to fall between lines of verse and other phrase contexts;</li>
                <li>the <code>rend:linebreak</code> element has been added;</li>
                <li>the DIAGRAM <code>description</code> feature has been incorporated;</li>
                <li>various minor documentation fixes.</li>
            </ul>
