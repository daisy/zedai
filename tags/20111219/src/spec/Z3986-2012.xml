            <title>Abstract</title>
            <para>The Z39.86 Authoring and Interchange (Z39.86-AI) Framework for Adaptive XML Publishing is a means of defining
                XML markup languages to represent different kinds of information resources (books,
                periodicals, etc.), with the intent of producing documents suitable for
                transformation into different universally accessible formats. It uses a modular,
                extensible architecture to permit the creation of any number of document models,
                each custom-tailored for a particular kind of information resource.</para>

            <para> This specification details the nature of Z39.86-AI profiles and how they are
                created. It is intended primarily for agencies interested in creating conformant profiles
                for new documents types and for processing agent developers.</para>
            <para> This specification is not a guide to marking up Z39.86-AI documents and should
                not be referenced as such. Informative resources that describe Z39.86-AI document
                production are available independently of this specification. </para>
            <para> Although this specification contains introductory sections where appropriate and
                deals with general document concepts in places, it is expected that all persons
                reading this specification will have a strong background in XML and its related
                technologies — in particular schema languages and their composition — in order to
                properly implement new profiles. </para>
        </section>

        <section xml:id="introductionDesignGoals">
            <title>Design goals</title>
            <para> The Z39.86-AI Framework has been built with the following primary design goals in mind: </para>

            <orderedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><emphasis>Adaptability</emphasis>. The Framework is designed to be
                        flexible and customizable across a wide variety of production environments.
                        Producers are not locked into a pre-defined schema, but can use the
                        built-in mechanisms for customization and extension to fit the Framework to
                        their specific requirements: profiles adapt to fit the information resources
                        they describe instead of the other way around, localizations are easily
                        implemented, and deployment in production environments spanning
                        the gamut of markup complexity — from complex/rich to simple/reduced
                        — is easily accommodated.</para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Modularity</emphasis>. Framework profiles are created using
                        discrete schema modules, building on and incorporating existing profiles and
                        standards where possible. The schema modules created for a profile, in turn,
                        can be reused when building other profiles, progressively decreasing the work 
                        required to create each new profile. The modular aspect of the framework also 
                        simplifies the development of processing tools by similarly reducing the 
                        number of custom components needed to accommodate new profiles.

                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Self-describing</emphasis>. The Framework is designed to move
                        beyond the often contentious issue of XML tag names alone defining the
                        semantics of the structures they represent. Finer control over the intent and
                        meaning of markup is now offered through the layering of RDF metadata. The
                        flexibility to attach multiple bibliographic record types to a document to meet 
                        the various needs it will serve is also now provided. </para>

                    <para>
                        <emphasis>Data repurposing</emphasis>. The primary goal of the specification
                        is to facilitate the parallel publishing of documents through its open
                        modular framework. Z39.86-AI profiles provide the essential
                        structures that compose documents in an unambiguous and format-agnostic way,
                        and are like a master blueprint to the information resources they describe.
                        As a result, Z39.86-AI documents can be manipulated through automated
                        transformation chains — such as specified by the XProc standard <xref
                            linkend="refXPROC"/> — to create output formats (e.g., print,
                        EPUB, etc.) and to create the inputs for alternate publishing processes 
                        (e.g., braille). </para>

            <title>Overview</title>

            <para> Creating <link linkend="termProfile">profiles</link> that conform to this specification requires
                understanding how the various concepts and technologies outlined in this document
                are bound together to define information resources. Although some readers
                will be sufficiently comfortable with XML technologies to jump straight into the specification,
                this overview provides a quick reference guide to how profiles are constructed and where 
                the requirements are defined for both novice and experienced developers alike. </para>

            <para> At the core of the Z39.86-AI specification is the Abstract Document Model, which
                introduces the framework common across all profile implementations, and the
                high-level rules to which profile creators must adhere in order to ensure
                consistency and predictability between grammars. The Abstract Document Model is like
                a map to building profiles and its concepts are fully introduced in <xref
                    linkend="abstractDocumentModel"/>. </para>
            
            <para> Understanding the Abstract Document Model is essential to understanding the rest
                of the specification, as the process of creating profiles involves formalizing rules to
                enforce the abstract concepts, as illustrated in the following diagram:
            </para>

            <mediaobject xml:id="specOverview_figure">
                <alt> The image shows the process of creating a profile through a flowchart-like
                    procession of boxes moving from top to bottom. At the top is the Abstract
                    Document Model, which is the starting point for creating any profile, as it
                    describes the composition rules. An arrow leads from this box to a more
                    intricate series of bounded boxes that together constitute profiles. Immediately
                    inside this profile box is a box that contains the main elements in creating a
                    markup model for a profile. The first component is the core markup model, which
                    is composed of the core modules and any other modules used. The second component
                    depicts the extensions and adaptations that go into creating the markup model:
                    features, metadata and the semantic inflection of elements. The profiles box
                    then has an arrow that leads to the final outputs of the process: the
                    publication of the profile via its resource directory document and the ability
                    to package documents in an OCF-based container. </alt>

            </mediaobject>

            <para> Profiles are the practical product of the Z39.86-AI specification and take the
                form of <link linkend="termMarkupModel">markup models</link> defining the structure 
                of information resources. The rules and requirements for creating them are detailed in 
                <xref linkend="profiles"/>. 
            </para>

            <para> Profiles are built on a modular model, allowing <link linkend="termModuleComponentDefinition">component 
                definitions</link> to be reused across Z39.86-AI profiles and to be included from other industry-standard
                grammars. The following sections of the specification introduce the various parts in
                their construction: </para>

            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        <xref linkend="modules"/> — Modules are sets of elements and
                        attributes that are semantically and/or structurally linked through the
                        traits they exhibit. Modules are activated when creating profiles and their
                        components become the building blocks for composing the new grammar. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        <xref linkend="coreModules"/> — The core modules are a set of modules
                        maintained by the Z39.86 Advisory
                        Committee to encourage reuse of components across profiles. </para>
                </listitem>
                <listitem>
                    <para>
                        <xref linkend="features"/> — Like a cross between profiles in
                        miniature and highly-specialized modules, features provide comprehensive
                        markup to represent very particular kinds of structures (e.g. MathML, Ruby,
                        etc.). Features help ensure the consistency of specialized markup between
                        Z39.86-AI documents and ensure that Z39.86-AI profiles are properly aligned
                        with industry standards. </para>
                </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>

            <para> RDF is the primary means provided by the Framework for the expression of metadata
                about documents and for the semantic inflection of meaning on elements they contain.
                Although profile creators can use other methods to annotate their data, the use of
                <link linkend="termRDFVocab">RDF vocabularies</link> is encouraged because of their
                tight binding to the specification. Information on how to apply the available attributes 
                and vocabularies can be found in <xref linkend="rdfVocabularies"/>. </para>

            <para> A completed profile will typically consist of a variety of different resources,
                such as schema files, RDF vocabularies, additional prose restrictions as well as
                usage and other documentation. The publishing of a profile is the act of assigning it an
                identity URI (see <xref linkend="profileConformanceIdentityURI"/>), at which
                location a <link linkend="termRD">resource directory</link> document is available that 
                enumerates these resources
                and provides additional information on how to obtain them. Complete information on
                how to create resource directories and documents is available in <xref
                    linkend="resourcedirectory"/>. </para>

            <para> This specification also includes a catalog of profiles that have been made
                publicly available for use creating documents (available in <xref
                    linkend="catalogs"/>). Producers are not required to use these profiles,
                but they have been designed for the widest use possible to encourage their adoption.
                The profiles represent fully-compliant implementations of this specification for developers
                or individuals looking for practical representations of the specification.
            </para>

            <para> Although this specification is not specifically intended for document creators,
                it does contain information about the general nature of document creation, including
                how to specify the profile a document conforms to, any features in use, as well as
                required metadata that must be included to identify the document. This information
                can be found in <xref linkend="documents"/>. </para>

            <para> This specification also includes a packaging format based on the Open Container Format
                <xref linkend="refOCF"/>, which can be used to bundle the XML, image and other
                local resources that compose a <link linkend="termZAIDocumentSet">Z39.86-AI document set</link>.
                It also specifies a MIME type for the container format to facilitate the interchange 
                of these files. This information can be found in <xref linkend="container"/> and in 
                <xref linkend="mediaTypeRegistration"/>. </para>

            <para> In addition to gaining a full understanding of all the topics outlined above,
                processing agent developers must also ensure that their applications meet the

            <title>Introduction</title>

            <para>The Abstract Document Model underpins the Z39.86-AI specification, providing the
                base structure through which all document profiles are defined. It is both a concept for 
                defining the structure of documents and a model for creating valid Z39.86-AI profiles:
                the central concept of the model being that documents can be decomposed to a common 
                foundation and that functionality can be built up in distinct layers.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                Four such layers of increasing structural markup granularity are defined to cover the major 
                components of a document: a general section layer for the hierarchical structure, a block 
                layer for container elements, a layer for phrase constructs and finally the layer containing 
                the text data of the document. 
                The Abstract Document Model does not just define element structure, however; it 
                additionally defines two complementary collections of attributes that flow through the 
                element layers (the global and metadata attribute collections). It also exposes all of these 
                layers and collections for customization and extension, which is where its flexibility for 
                representing new document types lies.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                The following diagram provides a visual perspective of how the layers 
                work in a bounding box-like fashion:

                    this pyramid of boxes lie the two attribute collections with an arrow pointing
                    into the layers to indicate how they feed into all. </alt>

                    <para>The document foundation and four layers of the Abstract Document
                        Model.</para>
                </caption>
            </mediaobject>

            <para>
                The layers of the Abstract Document Model are also how the model moves from abstraction
                of a document into formalization of the concept: they are more than just a 
                way of conceiving of a document, but represent the practical implementation of each profile
                through schema classes. Profile creators cannot change the document foundation, nor can 
                they add or remove layers nor their inherent traits. The ability to create new profiles to 
                describe information resources lies in the freedom offered within each layer to include 
                elements and attributes to create new markup models.
                As a result, the Abstract Document Model can be used to create schematic
                definitions for documents across a wide spectrum of formats and fields while
                ensuring a predictable core structure.
            </para>

            <para>The Z39.86-AI specification was built on this model specifically
                to address the problem of extensibility that existed in earlier versions of the
                standard. No single schema can encompass all document types and provide all the
                structure and flexibility necessary to generate all accessible formats. Although extension
                points were introduced in previous versions to try and address this problem,

                <para> At the root of the Abstract Document Model is the document foundation. The
                    foundation, as its name implies, defines the concrete concept of a document and
                    provides the practical containers through which the layers operate to define
                    information resources. </para>

                <para> The document foundation also represents the universal concept of a Z39.86-AI
                    document: as composed of a container for metadata
                    and other informational resources and a container to express the body content of the
                    document. The foundation and this principle are constants across all profile

                    inline elements. The new Section layer abstracts higher-level document structure
                    concepts and the Text layer formally separates character data from the "inline"

                    Moving down through the Abstract Document Model, each layer is structurally
                    subservient to the layers that contain it, meaning no layer can
                    contain elements from a superordinate layer. Using the preceding example to
                    illustrate, it would be invalid for either <code>block</code>
                    element to contain a child <code>section</code> element, as the nature of
                    the Block layer prevents its elements from representing the hierarchical structure
                    of a document.

                            in the following constraint. Changing or adding layers would make the model

                            contexts (e.g., a quote element could not be created in the Section 
                            layer as a quote does not
                            represent a structural division of a document). Refer to each layer's

                            neutral element that embodies the nature of the layer in the

                            to replace the default member (for example, a newspaper profile could replace 
                            the <code>section</code> element with an <code>article</code> element 
                            as the default member of the Section layer). Refer to the specialization rules
                            in each layer's implementation section and in the component definition for

            <para>Modules are the high-level building blocks of Z39.86-AI profiles and together with
                    <link linkend="features">features</link> form the basis through which new markup
                models are created. Modules may be pre-defined (as in the case of the <link

                to fit specific structural needs or may be made available for public use
                by interest groups.</para>

            <para>Modules, in their practical form, are schema files that define custom components —
                such as elements and attributes — for use in building profiles. The components
                within any module typically share a common nature or serve a common structural
                purpose, allowing the targeted activation of modules for specific uses. This
                approach to module definition enables element and attribute counts to be kept to a
                minimum when composing new grammars.</para>

            <title>Module and component definitions</title>

            <para>Module and component definitions are informational resources that define the
                nature of a given module and its components. These definitions provide
                the default state of modules and components prior to activation, as well as
                high-level instruction on their proper use. </para>

            <para> A definition must contain the module name, its dependencies and a
                description of its purpose. Each component defined in the module must also be 
                listed along with usage information, as outlined in <xref linkend="modulesComponents"/>.

            <para> There are no rules on the format and structure of a definition resource. So long 
                as complete information about the nature and traits of each module and component 
                is made available in human readable form, the requirement to provide a definition has been
                satisfied. </para>

            <para> Definitions must be provided for all module components created
                specifically for use in the Z39.86-AI Framework, and each profile's
                <link linkend="resourcedirectory">resource directory</link> must indicate the location of 
                these definitions. Core module definitions are available

                Definitions for imported features are recommended but are not a requirement,

            <para> Note that module and component definitions are not a reference to how 
                to mark up a document to conform to a specific profile and should never be 
                consulted to resolve validation issues. The normative schema available in the

                A profile is the collection of resources that together define the rules 
                and requirements for marking up an information resource. Profiles are typically
                equated with XML schemas, but a schema may be only one of a number
                of resources that define the requirements: the prose definition that accompanies
                each module may outline implicit attribute values that must be 
                recognized when an attribute is not present, for example, and an RDF vocabulary may
                define a set of allowed role values for adding semantic information to elements.
                It is also not uncommon that more than one schema may define the markup requirements: 
                a RelaxNG schema to express the general structure of a document and a Schematron 
                schema to express finer-grained conformance logic.

            <para> This specification does not place any restrictions on the scope of profiles: depending on 
                their intended use, profiles can have a wide scope (such as a general book profile) or they

            <para>
                The process of creating a profile typically begins with the authoring of a schema 
                to represent the desired information resource(s).
                The Z39.86-AI Framework encourages a plug-in model for creating schemas, whereby existing 
                modules and features are re-used so that only the specialized requirements of the profile result in 
                new elements and attributes.
            </para>
            
            <para>
                A thorough understanding of the requirements of this specification will be necessary to successfully
                create a new schema. Compliance with the <link linkend="abstractDocumentModel">Abstract Document Model</link>, 
                for example, requires that all profiles must first include the 
                <link xlink:href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2012/auth/cm/#z3986.document.module">document module</link> 
                in their schema driver file (the schema file that will be referenced by validators) to establish 
                the root <code>document</code> element. The
                <link xlink:href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2012/auth/cm/#z3986.global-classes.module">global-classes module</link>
                must then be imported to establish the Abstract Document Model classes into which all other 
                module and feature components will be added.
            </para>
            
            <para>    
                This process of dependency and required component inclusion continues until a complete 
                markup model is established that conforms to the requirements outlined in 
                <xref linkend="profileConformanceMarkupModel"/> (see also <xref linkend="moduleActivation"/>
                for more information on the inclusion process). 
                It is also during this process that other external resources, such as RDF vocabularies, 
                will be identified and incorporated into the profile.
            </para>

            <para> The next step in creating a profile is to determine whether, in fact, a new unique profile
                has been created. The uniqueness of a profile cannot be 
                determined solely by the modules and features that it includes, however;
                it is possible for many unique profiles to be created using the same core
                modules. The actual distinction between profiles is determined by variations across
                all of the following key factors: </para>

            <title>Introduction</title>

            <para>Certain kinds of content structures have highly specialized requirements for
                representation and processing, but have limited scope within information
                resources. A typical example is mathematical equations, where there already exists a
                specialized markup to represent them <xref linkend="refMATHML"/>. Z39.86-AI features are designed to
                handle these kinds of structures.</para>

            <para> Features have much in common with profiles: each feature defines a markup model
                and has a unique URI associated with it which serves as its identifier, and which
                resolves to a unique <link linkend="resourcedirectory">resource directory</link>.
                Features are more specialized, however, and narrower in scope: they are not intended
                to be used as complete markup languages on their own. In the Z39.86-AI framework,
                features can be considered optional add-ons to profiles. </para>

            <para>Features typically only expose a small set of elements and attributes for
                reference within the content models defined by profiles. These components are
                defined by the feature in its associated normative prose in order to ensure
                consistency of usage across Z39.86-AI profiles. The predictability of features
                further allows processing agents to support them independently of the profiles that
                might reference them.</para>

            <para>Profiles explicitly declare which (if any) features they support. If a profile
                supports a feature, it becomes a "host" of this feature, and the profile's normative
                schema includes the schema fragment defined by the feature.</para>

                <title>Feature identity URI</title>
                <para> Each feature must define an identity URI that serves as its unique
                    identifier.</para>
                <para>An example feature identity URI is:
                        <code>http://www.example.org/z3986/2012/auth/features/myFeature/1.0/</code>
                </para>
                
                <para> The identity URI
                    must resolve to a <link linkend="resourcedirectory">resource directory</link> where the
                    feature is defined. </para>
                
                <para> The provider of the feature owns the identity URI and must assure that the
                    identity URI has no public access restrictions and is valid with respect to <xref
                        linkend="refRFC3986"/>. </para>
                
                <para> When comparing two identity URIs for equality, processing agents must follow the
                    rules specified by <xref linkend="refRFC3986"/>. </para>

            <para> The purpose of authoring Z39.86-AI profiles is ultimately to allow the creation
                of documents that represent information resources. A Z39.86-AI document is a
                well-formed XML document that conforms to all the normative constraints defined by a
                profile and any included features.</para>

            <para> Although Z39.86-AI documents may exist as single XML files that reference no
                additional local or remote resources, a complete Z39.86-AI document set typically
                will include local resources (such as included XML fragments, images, style sheets
                and metadata records), as well as reference remote resources that can be obtained by
                their protocol (web-hosted resources available over HTTP or FTP, for example). To
                simplify the distribution of documents, the Z39.86-AI Framework consequently also
                defines a <link linkend="container">container format specification</link> for the
                bundling of local resources with their associated Z39.86-AI document. </para>

            <title>Referencing profiles and features</title>

            <para> Documents must reference the profile to which they adhere via a <link
                    xlink:href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2012/auth/cm/#z3986.meta">meta</link>
                element in the metadata container element (see <xref
                    linkend="abstractDocumentModel_documentFoundation"/>). The profile's identity
                URI must be given in the <code>resource</code> attribute and the value of the
                    <code>rel</code> attribute must contain the term <code>profile</code> (as
                defined in the <link linkend="rdfPredefinedVocabsDecl">Z39.86-2012 Instance Metadata
                Vocabulary</link>). The unique name and version number of the profile must also be identified
                using the <code>name</code> and <code>version</code> properties.</para>

            <para>Each feature used in the document must also be referenced via a <code>meta</code>
                element in the metadata container. In referencing features, the <code>rel</code>
                attribute must contain the term <code>feature</code> (as defined in the <link

                    Vocabulary</link>). Each feature similarly must reference its unique name and
                version number.</para>


            <para> The following is an example of a compliant profile and feature reference in the
                    <code>head</code> element of a Z39.86-AI document.</para>

            <para>
                Documents must include a <code>meta</code> element in the document <code>head</code> that references

            <para>
                The referenced context document may define a default vocabulary, which allows the
                terms from that vocabulary to be added in their unprefixed form. A document that has the
                <link linkend="rdfPredefinedVocabsCore">Z39.86-2012 Structural Semantics Vocabulary</link>
                as its default, for example, would allow the use of the <code>chapter</code> term from that vocabulary
                as follows:
            </para>
            
            <example>

            <para>
                The referenced RDFa context document may also define one or more fixed prefixes for referencing terms from additional 
                vocabularies. The previous example would change to the following if the Z39.86-2012 Structural Semantics 
                Vocabulary were instead associated with the prefix <code>struct</code>:

                <para> Access to comprehensive metadata is critical to producers, distributors, and
                    consumers of books and other digital resources. Fulfilling this need is
                    complicated, however, by the wide variety of standards and applications of
                    metadata. In response, the Z39.86-AI Framework has been created with an open
                    approach to specifying and attaching information resources: </para>

                <itemizedlist>

                        <para> it allows producers to reference multiple information resources,
                            conforming to different standards, as their internal and external needs
                            require, dropping the rigidity of embedded metadata; </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>

                            attribute for attaching machine-readable and grammar-definable metadata,
                            ensuring that metadata has first-class standing within the Framework and
                            can be easily attached where needed and as needed; and </para>
                    </listitem>
                    <listitem>
                        <para> it incorporates metadata elements and attributes that allow for
                            self-documentation of Framework components, simplifying the process of
                            creating and publishing new profiles. </para>
                    </listitem>
                </itemizedlist>

                <para> The rationale for referencing document metadata resources instead of
                    embedding is two-fold. First, it allows the variety needed to meet the
                    real-world production needs of producers. Second, using the Z39.86-AI document
                    itself as the source of metadata is not an intuitively sound design principle:
                    information retrieval, processing and sharing are all greatly enhanced when
                    metadata information remains distinct from the object it describes. </para>

                <para> The move to standardized metadata attributes brings the specification in line
                    with current best practices for attaching metadata. It also brings a measure of
                    consistency to metadata by allowing controlled vocabularies to be defined (i.e.,
                    semantics are not purely at the discretion of producers). </para>

                <para> There is no imperative that the complete document metadata actually appear in
                    the document itself, so long as the document can be unambiguously identified and
                    include information on how to obtain additional metadata. With that information,
                    a processing agent can access whatever other information might be
                    necessary — if any — to complete its work. </para>

                <para> The metadata requirements for a Z39.86-AI document serve two purposes: <orderedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>to uniquely identify the document and its publisher; and</para>

                        </listitem>
                    </orderedlist> Z39.86-AI documents use mandated Dublin Core metadata to identify
                    the document and its publisher. Additional <!--External--> metadata is
                    referenced by URI using constructs defined by an RDF vocabulary. The method of
                    linking to metadata encompasses strategies as simple as a self-reference to the
                    document itself (if the producer chooses to include metadata within the
                    document), or as complex as URIs to web services that allow the querying of
                    producer databases directly. Multiple complementary metadata may be referenced,
                    allowing for different metadata standards to be used by different kinds of
                    systems. </para>

                <para>Z39.86-AI documents may contain elements that function as micro-documents. The 
                    <link xlink:href="http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2012/auth/cm/#z3986.article"><code>article</code></link> 
                    element, for example, incorporates its own metadata container and content body, allowing it
                    to function as a self-contained document. Typical <xref linkend="refRDFa11"/> processing of 
                    metadata expressions, however, requires that an expression that doesn't identify its subject 
                    (e.g., via an <code>about</code> attribute) "bubble up" to the nearest containing expression
                    (see the concept of <emphasis>chaining</emphasis> in <xref linkend="refRDFa11"/>). 
                    If none is found, the expression represents some aspect of the document as a whole, such as its
                    unique identifier or publisher.</para>
                
                <para>In the case of micro-document elements, metadata without an explicit association ideally would
                    similarly define some aspect of the containing micro-document. An RDFa processor will not make 
                    this association implicitly in the way that it does with the document, however, because the processor 
                    has no concept of containing elements. Consequently, it will either associate the 
                    expression with a property further up the document chain or with the document itself. 
                    Although the correct processing behavior, it is not what many authors will expect when adding 
                    metadata to a micro-document element.</para>
                
                <para>To simplify the process of adding metadata to micro-documents, this specification introduces 
                    a special implied association mechanism for elements intended to function as micro-documents: 
                    the container element must be handled as though it has an <code>about</code> attribute attached 
                    that defines itself as the subject of all such expressions.</para>
                
                <para>To exemplify, the following micro-document element declaration:</para>
                
                <informalexample conformance="informative">
                    <programlisting><![CDATA[<article>]]></programlisting>
                </informalexample>
                
                <para>must be treated as equivalent to the following RDFa expression:</para>
                
                <informalexample conformance="informative">
                    <programlisting><![CDATA[<article xml:id="article01" about="#article01">]]></programlisting>
                </informalexample>
                
                <para>By adding this implied association, all metadata defined within the container is ensured
                    to have the micro-document as its subject if no other is defined.</para>
                
                <para>Only elements that include both a metadata container and content body should be treated as
                    micro-documents and enabling this behavior. If implicit associations are not desired, an element's
                    documentation must explicitly state the lack of this supporting behavior.</para>
                
                <para>In order to generate an accurate RDF graph from a document that relies on implied associations, 
                    a processing step to make all implicit associations explicit will need to be undertaken first, 
                    which may or may not also include adding missing <code>xml:id</code> attributes. Authors are 
                    encouraged to avoid relying on this implied mechanism, and the requisite intermediary processing, 
                    when RDF metadata generation and manipulation is an important workflow requirement.</para>

            <para> The need to package Z39.86 documents together with the local resources they
                reference has always existed, but the method and format for achieving this goal has
                not been formally defined in previous versions of the specification. As a result,
                producers have had the freedom to package their document sets in any of a variety of
                formats as their needs required, while user agent developers have been left with the
                problem of handling this variation when processing the container files. </para>
            <para> This specification seeks to redress this issue by formally defining the packaging
                format and MIME type for bundling the local resources in Z39.86-AI document set, as
                well as to propose a common file extension format for the identification of
                container files. This approach will allow the rapid deployment and exchange of
                container files by removing the unnecessary ambiguity and investigation that has
                existed regarding their format and structure. </para>

            <note>
                <para> Although remote resources are an integral part of a document set, they are
                    referenced and obtained from their remote location by processing agents. Remote
                    resources optionally can be obtained and included as local resources within the
                    container for distribution/processing purposes, but any references to them in
                    the Z39.86-AI document should be updated to point to their new local location to
                    prevent repeat requests by processing agents. </para>

        <section xml:id="container_format">
            <title>Format</title>
            <para> The Z39.86-AI container format uses a modified version of the Open Container
                Format <xref linkend="refOCF"/> to bundle into a single file all the local 
                resources that constitute a Z39.86-AI document set. All
                requirements detailed in the OCF specification apply to the creation of Z39.86-AI
                container files, except where modified by this section. </para>

            <para> The Z39.86-AI container format employs the modified version of the ZIP format
                detailed in Section 4 of <xref linkend="refOCF"/>. For identifying
                that the file is a Z39.86-AI container, however, the following MIME type must be
                used instead: <code>application/z3986-auth+zip</code> (see <xref
                    linkend="container_mediaTypes"/>). </para>

            <para> Each conformant container file must include a <code>META-INF</code> directory at
                the root of the container as per Section 3.5 of <xref linkend="refOCF"/>. This
                directory must include the required <code>container.xml</code> file detailed in
                Section 3.5.1 of <xref linkend="refOCF"/>,
                which in turn must contain a <code>rootfile</code> element
                that points to the root Z39.86-AI document. </para>

            <para> The root document must be identified by the MIME type <code>application/z3986-auth+xml</code>
                (see <xref linkend="container_mediaTypes"/>) and the
                container must include the root document as a resource; it is not permitted to reference a
                document external to the container. If a document has been decomposed into smaller
                XML fragments, the root must be the XML file into which all the components are
                included to reconstitute the complete Z39.86-AI document. </para>

            <para> The container must include the Z39.86-AI document together with all of the 
                local resources associated with it. The container may include alternate renditions
                of a document, but must not contain more than a single Z39.86-AI document. </para>

            <para>Profiles and features are fully-developed markup languages in their own rights,
                and typically require multiple documents to define them normatively: schemas, RDF
                vocabularies, and often normative prose. Profiles and features typically also provide
                informative resources, such as primers, best practice guides, and
                references to supporting software to assist users with their implementation.
            </para>
            
            <para>To facilitate the discovery of these resources for both human and machine users alike,
                this specification uses XHTML+RDFa <xref linkend="refXHTMLRDFa"/> 
                as the mechanism to associate a collection of normative and informative resources 
                with a profile or a feature. The XHTML+RDFa document used to collect the references 
                to these resources is called a resource directory.</para>

            <para>As XHTML documents, resource directories are human-readable, and thus can serve as
                the primary source of information for all users of a profile or feature. Resource
                directories are also machine-readable documents, and thus can be sources for the
                discovery and retrieval of schemas, style sheets, RDF vocabularies and other types
                of resources needed by processing agents.</para>

            <para>In order to facilitate interoperability of processing agents, this specification
                defines a <xref linkend="rdfPredefinedVocabsRD"/>. This vocabulary contains terms

                An initial context document, as defined in section 9 of <xref linkend="refRDFa11"/>,
                is an XHTML+RDFa <xref linkend="refXHTMLRDFa"/> document that defines

                well as any additional vocabulary prefixes directly supported.
                Each Z39.86-AI profile must specify the URI of its initial context document in its resource directory

                include a revision history. Processing agent developers consequently need to be aware that 
                changes may occur independently of profiles and take measures to ensure that inconsistencies 
                do not arise.

            <title>Introduction</title>

            <para> Processing agents are the applications used to interact with a Z39.86-AI document
                during its lifecycle, from its creation through to its provision to end users.
                Primary examples include programs that facilitate the markup of documents (XML editors 
                and word processing applications), programs that check document integrity (validators),
                and programs that process documents to create final output formats (transformation
                pipelines). Note that the definition of processing agent as used in this
                specification does not include applications used for consumption by end users,
                as this specification does not cover the user-oriented formats that may result
                from the transformation of a Z39.86-AI document.
            </para>

            <para>Processing agents are not expected to be able to handle any Z39.86-AI document
                that they encounter. A processing agent declares support for profiles individually,
                and must abort processing whenever it encounters a document conforming to a profile
                that it does not support, and by default also when encountering a document
                conforming to a supported profile but with an unsupported version number (either
                newer or older). Although this restriction is severe, it ensures that documents are
                not rendered in a way that contradicts their intended use, and that any resulting outputs are
                not prone to bugs resulting from the passive application of new
                or out-dated rules. This draconian abort principle is primarily motivated by the
                anticipated use of the Z39.86-AI framework in fully automated provisioning contexts
                where errors must not pass through silently, and where the integrity of the output
                cannot be manually controlled.</para>

            <para> A processing agent's support for features is independent of its support for
                profiles, and by default the same draconian abort principle applies when
                encountering an unrecognized or unsupported feature. As described in <xref
                    linkend="processingAgentConformanceInitializationBehavior"/>, however, features
                may define fallback methods that allow processing agents to adapt their behavior in
                a controlled manner and continue processing the document in spite of the fact that a
                given feature is not supported. </para>

            <para> All processing agents should provide complete profile and feature support
                information to users in order to reduce the likelihood that they will be used to
                process incompatible documents and to ensure that they conform to user expectations. </para>

                    typically not backwards compatible with earlier major releases. </para>

                <para> Changes that result in major releases may not always reflect significant
                    changes to content models, but may alter the way that content should be handled
                    or processed. Data conforming to a previous major releases consequently must not
                    be assumed to be be compatible with a new major release, even where that data

                identifies them and allows earlier and/or later iterations to be distinguished. In
                the case of profiles and modules, the version number must consist of both a major

            <para> It is recommended when issuing new releases that both major and minor indicators
                are incremented in steps of 1. Decrementing of indicators is not permitted, even
                where integer values have been skipped between releases. </para>

            <para> Minor indicators must be padded with 0s to two digits, to prevent the
                sequentiality issues that arise with single digits (e.g., to prevent issues
                determining if <code>1.91</code> is the successor of <code>1.90</code> or
                    <code>1.9</code>). Three digit padding may be used where a high revision release
                schedule is anticipated between major revisions. The padding scheme used must,
                however, remain consistent across a major release, but can change from major release
                to major release. </para>

            <para> It is not valid to append alphabetic identifiers to either major or minor numbers
                (e.g. <code>1.12a</code>). Only integer values are permitted. </para>

            <para> A major number of 0 should only be used for profiles, modules and features that
                are in a pre-release state. </para>

                minor release, either embedded within their source or as a part of their abstract
                definition or documentation. The revision history must specify the nature of the
                changes made and their impact on processing agents. </para>
