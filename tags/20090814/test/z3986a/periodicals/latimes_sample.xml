                    <p>Riding in a Ford pickup with five gun-toting soldiers, he pulls over
                        suspicious-looking cars, sets up impromptu roadblocks to search for drugs
                        and weapons, and tends to the nuisance calls that make up a cop's life:
                        robberies, street fights, fender benders.</p>
                    <p>"I am an army lieutenant colonel," Resendiz said. "But now we're all
                        police."</p>
                    <p>Ciudad Juarez resembles a city under military occupation as President Felipe
                        Calderon ratchets up his war against drug traffickers.</p>
                    <p>Calderon launched the military offensive 10 days after assuming office in
                        December 2006, saying it was necessary to restore government authority in
                        parts of the country. Today, 2 1/2 years later, Calderon and Mexico face a
                        stark reality: The longer and harder the war is prosecuted, the more complex
                        and daunting it becomes.</p>
                    <p>The offensive has exposed corruption so widespread that key institutions,
                        from police forces to city halls, appear rotten to the core. And a battered
                        society has grown increasingly worried about the effects of the massive
                        military deployment on its democracy.</p>
                    <p>A cascade of setbacks -- prison breakouts, kidnappings of federal officials,
                        killing of priests -- has led to questions about whether Calderon was
                        prepared for the breadth and depth of the problem.</p>
                    <p>By disrupting the cartels' operations, the offensive intensified turf
                        struggles among the traffickers. About 11,000 people, some of them
                        bystanders, have died in the violence.</p>
                    <p>"They hit a wasp nest, and the wasps are stinging," said Jose Luis Pineyro,
                        an expert on national security at Mexico City's Autonomous Metropolitan
                        University. "There definitely wasn't a well-structured plan to know what
                        kind of threat they were confronting."</p>
                    <p>Government forces have scored victories, almost all credited to the military:
                        They've arrested more than <pagebreak value="A18"/> 66,000 suspects, seized
                        tons of cocaine and marijuana, and intercepted guns, grenades, airplanes --
                        even drug-laden, submarine-like vessels.</p>
                    <p>But every success is offset quickly by a fresh surge in violence, sometimes
                        in unexpected places such as the tourist magnet of Acapulco. No state has
                        been spared bloodshed or scandal. To date, the government has not gone after
                        major money-laundering operations, the fuel that keeps the cartels going,
                        and none of the current leaders of the main cartels has been captured.</p>
                    <p>"It's very hard to stop this trend," a senior military official in Ciudad
                        Juarez said, speaking of the unyielding bloodshed. "We are fighting an enemy
                        we don't know and don't see and only feel their results."</p>
                    <p>The drug gangs appear as strong and as vicious as ever as they fight not just
                        for smuggling routes but for shares of the growing domestic market. Mexican
                        cartels are now the dominant force in an industry once led by Colombians. </p>
                    <p>More than 45,000 troops have been deployed in these 2 1/2 years to hot spots
                        across the nation. It's not just boots on the ground: Army generals and
                        colonels have taken command of law enforcement in seven states and, from
                        Juarez to Tijuana to Cancun, have supplanted civilian authority.</p>
                    <p>Ciudad Juarez, a city of 1.3 million, remains the test case, embodying the
                        reach of Calderon's strategy and its risks. The military buildup in Juarez
                        came after months of extraordinary violence. About 1,600 people were killed
                        last year, including more than 200 in November alone.</p>
                    <p>In February, the police chief quit after several officers were shot dead and
                        signs appeared threatening that more would be killed unless he stepped down.
                        Other posters threatened the life of Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz. The governor
                        of the state, Chihuahua, was ambushed in the state capital. (He survived,
                        but his bodyguard was killed.)</p>
                    <p>Juarez officials appealed for federal help, and in March, Calderon's
                        government sent 5,000 troops and 1,900 federal police officers -- adding to
                        the 2,500 soldiers and police already there.</p>
                    <h role="subtitle">Reliance on army</h>
                    <p>A retired general, Julian Rivera Breton, was appointed public safety chief,
                        and an active-duty colonel, Alfonso Cristobal Garcia Melgar, was installed
                        as police director. In all, 30 current or former military officers now hold
                        supervisory roles in the police department.</p>

                    <p role="byline"> For a group of African American women in L.A., bad habits and
                        backsliding are out. They're learning how to grow old well. </p>
                    <p role="authoranno">Maria L. Ganga</p>
                    <p>Etta Cummings stood in the back of a small room filled with sympathetic
                        faces. Her failing eyes were obscured by big, dark glasses. She leaned on
                        her cane, clutched her bright caftan and prepared to take one very big
                        step.</p>
                    <p>"My name is Etta Cummings. I'm a diabetic. My diabetes is totally out of
                        control. I didn't take it seriously for many, many years," she said by way
                        of introduction. "By this time, my health started deteriorating, so I'm on
                        the run to correct it."</p>
                    <p>Heads nodded in support. Other women's stories poured forth. Of diabetes and
                        struggles with weight. The difficulty of caregiving and the effort of
                        exercise. The temptation of unhealthy food and the jettisoning of "toxic
                        relationships." The fear of doctors and the burden of stress -- code, to
                        many of those present, for depression.</p>
                    <p>One Thursday evening each month, a dozen or so African American women in
                        their 50s or older make their way to the third-floor lounge at Olympia
                        Medical Plaza in Mid-Wilshire to learn how to grow old well. After half a
                        century or more of putting other people first, of bad habits and
                        backsliding, they have decided they want to change their lives and help one
                        another do the same. </p>
                    <p>For this sisterhood of the hopeful and health-minded, Cummings was both
                        fellow striver and cautionary tale. The wiry 69-year-old had discovered a
                        diabetic ulcer in her foot. She went to the doctor, she told the group
                        during this, her first meeting, because she couldn't see the wound, couldn't
                        bandage it, "but I could smell it."</p>
                    <p>The fact that these women, a.k.a. Sisters Staying Healthy, meet each month to
                        talk about dementia and brain fitness, menopause and sexual health, stress
                        reduction and vegetarian cooking is unusual enough in an era in which
                        Americans spend billions of dollars to <pagebreak value="A6"/> avoid aging
                        altogether.</p>
                    <p>But what they are trying to do is even harder because of who they are.
                        African American women are among the least healthy women in America. Even in
                        health-conscious Los Angeles, they have the highest death rates from all
                        causes, but especially from heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer.</p>
                    <p>"There is inequality in life expectancy," said Eleanor Brownn, the group's
                        founder, champion, cheerleader and increasingly slender poster child. "It's
                        not just the length of your life, but also, when you start looking at
                        African Americans, we're sicker than everybody."</p>
                    <p>But not if Brownn can do something about it.</p>
                    <p>It was 2002 when Brownn put it all together. She was attending a women's
                        health conference at UC San Francisco when a chart flashed on the big
                        screen. "Life expectancy," it read, and the bar for African Americans was
                        much shorter than for every other ethnicity. Frighteningly shorter. </p>
                    <p>Brownn started thinking of all the people she knew who had died prematurely.
                        Her co-worker, who died of lung cancer in her 50s.Her foster brother, who
                        was 8 when he succumbed after a straightforward operation to correct a "lazy
                        eye." Her beloved father, who died at 60 of bladder cancer. She heard her
                        mother's voice questioning the care those loved ones had received from a
                        white medical establishment.</p>

                    </object>
                    <p>Growing up in South Los Angeles, Brownn remembered finding a lump in her
                        breast when she was 14, two months after her father's death, and waiting a
                        year before telling anyone "because I was afraid to go to the doctor." She
                        finally confided in her worried mother, but it took them another year to
                        muster the trust topursue medical treatment. The lump was benign.</p>
                    <p>And she thought about her first real job, as an outreach worker in the
                        Hypertension Control Project in Watts. Brownn spent her days contacting
                        African Americans who had been diagnosed with high blood pressure to make
                        sure they were taking their medication and seeing the doctor for follow-up
                        care.</p>
                    <p>Most weren't.</p>
                    <p> "They didn't trust the doctor," she said. "They knew they were sick. They
                        didn't want to take the pills. They thought they were being experimented on.
                        That's what resonates with me. I heard this over and over and over
                        again."</p>
                    <p>Brownn has focused her career as a community advocate on healthcare issues.
                        But that "aha!" moment at UCSF made her realize that she needed to do more
                        -- because that bar chart "meant lives lost."</p>
                    <p>As she likes to point out, "The numbers speak for themselves."</p>
                    <p>Life expectancy for black women is 75 years, according to "Death in the
                        Golden State," a 2007 report by the Public Policy Institute of California.
                        For white women, it's 80 years, Latinas, 83 and Asians, 85.</p>

                    <!-- how do we want to handle this? is it a callout or pullout http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callout  -->
                    <p>So a fewmonths after returning home from San Francisco, Brownn launched
                        Life-Long: Sisters Staying Healthy with a small conference on black women's
                        health. It has since become an annual event. Last November's conference,
                        funded by public and private grants, brought together healthcare
                        professionals, educators and 120 women. </p>
                    <p> A year and a half ago, she started the monthly meetings at Olympia Medical
                        Plaza -- part support group, part lecture series, part guided tour of
                        healthful living in the second 50 years of life. No subject is off-limits.
                        Few bodily functions go unmentioned.</p>
                    <p>Brownn knows that helping African American women be as healthy as everyone
                        else is a daunting task, that Sisters Staying Healthy is one very small
                        step. But she also knows that "in our little circle, you can touch one
                        person's life and that can make a difference." Brownn spreads the word via
                        e-mail, website and chutzpah. She recruited one member on a flight between
                        Sacramento and Los Angeles.</p>
                    <p>Her target audience: midlife, middle-class African American women stretched
                        to the limit with jobs and responsibilities. Brownn counts herself among
                        them. She is 58, has a master's degree in gerontology and a condo in Culver
                        City. She spent a decade caring for her ailing mother, who died at 79. She
                        is single and has no children. </p>
                    <p>Brownn will not divulge her weight through the years. But she is just under 5
                        feet 2, and she once wore size 22. Six clothing sizes hang in her closet
                        today. She eats like a diabetic, because she does not want to become one --
                        nothing white, everything steamed. Chocolate hasn't passed her lips since
                        1996.</p>
                    <p>"This is sort of now or never," she admitted to the group at its May meeting.
                        "Being connected to this group, I don't know if it's helping anybody else,
                        but it's helping me. There's something about being accountable to other
                        people and knowing that other people are going to be asking about you and
                        want to see you do well."</p>
                    <p>And how well is Brownn doing?</p>
                    <p>"I'm wearing white pants in a size I haven't worn." She stops. A pause. A
                        smile. "I don't think I wore this size at birth." The women laugh and clap.
                        Brownn continues: "There are a lot of things going on in my life right now
                        that aren't working. But you know, I feel healthy."</p>
                    <p>"I'm Michelle Kemp, and I took that bold step to remove myself from a toxic
                        work environment." "I'm Liz Smith, and I made a commitment to myself
                        recently that I'm going to take better care of myself." "I'm Brigette Kidd,
                        and this is my second meeting. This is great that I came today, because I
                        was actually feeling a little low."</p>
                    <p>That's how every session of Sisters Staying Healthy begins. It's the real
                        heart of Brownn's effort: Who are you and what have you done to take care of
                        yourself lately? Beyond the simple act of connection, beyond encouragement
                        and support, telling their stories allows these women to share information
                        in a way many never have before.</p>
                    <p>"We come from families that work hard, and we don't talk about going to the
                        doctor as a wellness program," Toni Laudermilk said. "We only go to the
                        doctor when we're flat on our back. And when we come home, we don't talk
                        about it. At least that's the kind of history most African Americans
                        experience. Our parents didn't say, oh, you know, your grandmother had a
                        double mastectomy."</p>
                    <p>Laudermilk runs the Center for LifeLong Learners, a nonprofit after-school
                        program in the West Adams neighborhood. Earlier this year she was diagnosed
                        with acinic cell adenocarcinoma, a rare cancer of the salivary glands, and
                        she has made her way regularly to Sisters Staying Healthy.</p>
                    <p> Talking with Brownn and the other women made the stylish 62-year-old realize
                        how important a family health history is and how little she knew about her
                        relatives -- and, by extension, her own body. She called her real sisters
                        and compared notes.</p>
                    <p>Laudermilk knew that her mother's mother had had a double mastectomy, because
                        she once walked in on the older woman dressing; no one ever said the reason
                        was cancer. Laudermilk didn't find out until her 40s that her Uncle Buddy's
                        missing leg had been amputated because of diabetes. </p>
                    <p>And then there's the other side of the family. Her father killed himself. His
                        brother killed his wife and committed suicide. The couple's babies spent two
                        days in the apartment alone with the bodies. The older one killed himself in
                        his 20s. The younger one grew up to be a recluse.</p>
                    <p>"Something was really, really off," Laudermilk said. "Once again, there was
                        never any conversation around it, so you know it's something I'll never have
                        an answer to. It is something I wonder."</p>
                    <p>Laudermilk's loved ones will have far fewer mysteries to unravel. Brownn gave
                        her a health diary and extra copies to hand out to her book group.</p>
                    <p>She is documenting her own condition. She's cataloging her husband's various
                        medications and the ailments they address. She'll soon be sitting down with
                        her daughter, Ch-a Mosley, and telling all. Families, she said, "need to
                        learn how to talk about their health issues."</p>
                    <p>And she's practicing just that, one Thursday evening each month.</p>
                    <p>"My name is Toni Laudermilk," she began recently before segueing into
                        menopause and weight gain, caring for an ailing mother and nurturing a
                        marriage, keeping a nonprofit afloat in a recession.</p>
                    <p>"It was all a bit much," she continued. "So I decided that I am slowly
                        getting myself back together so I can play tennis again, play with the
                        little senior ladies like I used to. I want to ski some more.</p>
                    <p>"I am not dead yet."</p>

                    <p>"I want to go back," she said, speaking by phone from her home in a rough
                        section of Baghdad. She was speaking of America. "I want to go back, as soon
                        as I can."</p>
                    <p>This was three summers ago. I wasn't sure, not until last month, not until I
