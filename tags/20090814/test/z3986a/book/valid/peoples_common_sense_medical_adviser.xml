                    <h>PREFACE TO THE PRESENT EDITION</h>
                    <p>The popular favor with which former editions of this work have been received
                        has required the production of such a vast number of copies, that the
                        original electrotype plates from which it has heretofore been printed, have
                        been completely worn out.</p>
                    <p>The book has been re-produced in London, England, where six editions have
                        already been necessary to supply the demand for it.</p>
                    <p>In order to continue its publication to meet the demand which is still active
                        in this country, it has been necessary, inasmuch as the original electrotype
                        plates have become worn and useless, to re-set the work throughout. This has
                        afforded the Author an opportunity to carefully revise the book and re-write
                        many portions, that it may embody the latest discoveries and improvements in
                        medicine and surgery. In performing this labor he has been greatly assisted
                        by contributions and valuable aid kindly supplied by his staff of associate
                        specialists in medicine and surgery who constitute the Faculty of the
                        Invalids' Hotel and Surgical Institute.</p>
                    <p>That part of the book treating of Diseases and Their Remedies will be found
                        to be thoroughly reliable; the prescriptions recommended therein having all
                        received the sanction and endorsement of medical gentlemen of rare
                        professional attainments and mature experience.</p>

                        <l>THE AUTHOR.</l>
                        <l>BUFFALO, N.Y., January, 1895.</l>

                <section>
                    <h>PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</h>
                    <p>Every family needs a COMMON SENSE MEDICAL ADVISER. The frequent inquiries
                        from his numerous patients throughout the land, suggested to the Author the
                        importance and popular demand for a reliable work of this kind.
                        Consequently, he has been induced to prepare and publish an extensive
                        dissertation on Physiology, Hygiene, Temperaments, Diseases and Domestic
                        Remedies. It is for the interest and welfare of <emph>every</emph> person,
                        not only to understand the means for the preservation of health, but also to
                        know what remedies should be employed for the alleviation of the common
                        ailments of life.</p>
                    <p>The frequency of accidents of all kinds, injuries sustained by machinery,
                        contusions, drowning, poisoning, fainting, etc., and also of sudden attacks
                        of painful diseases, such as headache, affections of the heart and nerves,
                        inflammation of the eye, ear and other organs, renders it necessary that
                        non-professionals should possess sufficient knowledge to enable them to
                        employ the proper means for speedy relief. To impart this important
                        information is the aim of the author.</p>
                    <p>Moreover, this volume treats of Human Temperaments, not only of their
                        influence upon mental characteristics and bodily susceptibilities, but also
                        of their vital and non-vital combinations, which transmit to the offspring
                        either health, hardihood, and longevity, or feebleness, disease, and death.
                        It clearly points out those temperaments which are compatible with each
                        other and harmoniously blend, and also those which, when united in marriage,
                        result in barrenness, or produce in the offspring imbecility, deformity, and
                        idiocy. These matters are freely discussed from original investigations and
                        clinical observations, thus rendering the work a true and scientific guide
                        to marriage.</p>
                    <p>While instruction is imparted for the care of the body, those diseases (alas
                        how prevalent!) are investigated which are sure to follow as a consequence
                        of certain abuses, usually committed through ignorance. That these ills do
                        exist is evident from the fact that the Author is consulted by multitudes of
                        unfortunate young men and women, who are desirous of procuring relief from
                        the weaknesses and derangements incurred by having unwittingly violated
                        physiological laws.</p>
                    <p>Although some of these subjects may seem out of place in a work designed for
                            <emph>every</emph> member of the family, yet they are presented in a
                        style which cannot offend the most fastidious, and with a studied avoidance
                        of all language that can possibly displease the chaste, or disturb the
                        delicate susceptibilities of persons of either sex.</p>
                    <p>This book should not be excluded from the young, for it is eminently adapted
                        to their wants, and imparts information without which millions will suffer
                        untold misery. It is a <emph>false</emph> modesty which debars the youth of
                        our land from obtaining such information.</p>
                    <p>As its title indicates, the Author aims to make this book a useful and
                        practical Medical Adviser. He proposes to express himself in plain and
                        simple language, and, so far as possible, to avoid the employment of

                        and profit by its perusal. Written as it is amid the many cares attendant
                        upon a practice embracing the treatment of thousands of cases annually, and
                        therefore containing the fruits of a rich and varied experience, some excuse

                <h>INTRODUCTORY WORDS.</h>
                <p>Health and disease are physical conditions upon which pleasure and pain, success
                    and failure, depend. Every <emph>individual</emph> gain increases public gain.
                    Upon the health of its people is based the prosperity of a nation; by it every
                    value is increased, every joy enhanced. Life is incomplete without the enjoyment
                    of healthy organs and faculties, for these give rise to the delightful
                    sensations of existence. Health is essential to the accomplishment of every
                    purpose; while sickness thwarts the best intentions and loftiest aims. We are
                    continually deciding upon those conditions which are either the source of joy
                    and happiness or which occasion pain and disease. Prudence requires that we
                    should meet the foes and obviate the dangers which threaten us, by turning all
                    our philosophy, science, and art, into practical <emph>common sense</emph>.</p>
                <p>The profession of medicine is no <emph>sinecure</emph>; its labors are constant,
                    its toils unremitting, its cares unceasing. The physician is expected to meet
                    the grim monster, "break the jaws of death, and pluck the spoil out of his
                    teeth." <emph>His</emph> ear is ever attentive to entreaty, and within his
                    faithful breast are concealed the disclosures of the suffering. Success may
                    elate him, as conquest flushes the victor. Honors are lavished upon the brave
                    soldiers who, in the struggle with the foe, have covered themselves with glory,
                    and returned victorious from the field of battle; but how much more brilliant is
                    the achievement of those who overwhelm disease, that common enemy of mankind,
                    whose victims are numbered by millions! Is it meritorious in the physician to
                    modestly veil his discoveries, regardless of their importance? If he have light,
                    why hide it from the world? Truth should be made as universal and health-giving
                    as sunlight. We say, give light to all who are in darkness, and a remedy to the
                    afflicted everywhere.</p>
                <p>We, as a people, are becoming idle, living in luxury and ease, and in the
                    gratification of artificial wants. Some indulge in the use of food rendered
                    unwholesome by bad cookery, and think more of gratifying a morbid appetite than
                    of supplying the body with proper nourishment. Others devote unnecessary
                    attention to the display of dress and a genteel figure, yielding themselves
                    completely to the sway of fashion. Such intemperance in diet and dress manifests
                    itself in the general appearance of the unfortunate transgressor, and exposes
                    his folly to the world, with little less precision than certain vices signify
                    their presence by a tobacco-tainted breath, beer-bloated body, rum-emblazoned
                    nose, and kindred manifestations. They coddle themselves instead of practicing
                    self-denial, and appear to think that the chief end of life is gratification,
                    rather than useful endeavor.</p>
                <p>I purpose to express myself candidly and earnestly on all topics relating to
                    health, and appeal to the common sense of the reader for justification. Although
                    it is my aim to simplify the work, and render it a practical common-sense guide
                    to the farmer, mechanic, mariner, and day-laborer, yet I trust that it may not
                    prove less acceptable to the scholar, in its discussion of the problems of Life.
                    Not only does the method adopted in this volume of treating of the Functions of
                    the Brain and Nervous System present many new suggestions, in its application to
                    hygiene, the management of disease, generation and the development and
                    improvement of man, but the conclusions correspond with the results of the
                    latest investigations of the world's most distinguished <emph>savants</emph>. My
                    object is to inculcate the facts of science rather than the theories of
                    philosophy.</p>
                <p>Unto us are committed important health trusts, which we hold, not merely in our
                    own behalf, but for the benefit of others. If we discharge the obligations of
                    our trusteeship, we shall enjoy present strength, usefulness, and length of
                    days; but if we fail in their performance, then inefficiency, incapacity, and
                    sickness, will follow, the sequel of which is pain and death. Let us, then,
                    prove worthy of this generous commission, that we may enjoy the sweetest of all
                    pleasures, the delicious fruitage of honest toil and faithful obedience.</p>

                    </h>
                    <p>In this chapter we propose to consider Life in its primitive manifestations.
                            <emph>Biology</emph> is the science of living bodies, or the science of
                        life. Every organ of a living body has a function to perform, and
                            <emph>Physiology</emph> treats of these functions.</p>
                    <p><emph>Function</emph> means the peculiar action of some particular organ or
                        part. There can be no vital action without change, and no change without
                        organs. Every living thing has a structure, and <emph>Anatomy</emph> treats
                        of the structures of organized bodies. Several chapters of this work are
                        devoted to <emph>Physiological Anatomy</emph>, which treats of the human
                        organism and its functions.</p>
                    <p>The beginning of life is called <emph>generation</emph>; its perpetuation,
                            <emph>reproduction</emph>. By the former function, individual life is
                        insured; by the latter, it is maintained. Since nutrition sustains life, it
                        has been pertinently termed <emph>perpetual reproduction</emph>.</p>
                    <p>LATENT LIFE is contained in a small globule, a mere atom of matter, in the
                        sperm-cell. This element is something which, under certain conditions,
                        develops into a living organism. The entire realm of nature teems with these
                        interesting phenomena, thus manifesting that admirable adjustment of
                        internal to external relations, which claims our profound attention. We are
                        simply humble scholars, waiting on the threshold of nature's glorious
                        sanctuary, to receive the interpretation of her divine mysteries.</p>
                    <p>Some have conjectured that chemical and physical forces account for all the
                        phenomena of life, and that organization is not the result of vital forces.
                        Physical science cannot inform us what the beginning was, or how vitality is
                        the result of chemical forces; nor can it tell us what transmutations will
                        occur at the end of organized existence. This mysterious life-principle
                        eludes the grasp of the profoundest scientists, and its presence in the
                        world will ever continue to be an astonishing and indubitable testimony of
                        Divine Power.</p>
                    <p>The physical act of generation is accomplished by the union of two cells; and
                        as this conjugation is known to be so generally indispensable to the
                        organization of life, we may fairly infer that it is a universal necessity.
                        Investigations with the microscope have destroyed the hypothesis of
                        "spontaneous generation." These show us that even the minutest living forms
                        are derived from a parent organization.</p>
                    <p>GENERATION. So long as the vital principle remains in the sperm-cell, it lies
                        dormant. That part of the cell which contains this principle is called the
                            <emph>spermatozooen</emph>, which consists of a flattened body, having a
                        long appendage tapering to the finest point. If it be remembered that a line
                        is the one-twelfth part of an inch in length, some idea may be formed of the
                        extreme minuteness of the body of a human spermatozooen, when we state that
                        it is from 1/800 to 1/600 part of a line, and the filiform tail 1/50 of a
                        line, in length. This life-atom, which can be discerned only with a powerful
                        magnifying glass, is perfectly transparent, and moves about by executing a
                        vibratile motion with its long appendage. Within this speck of matter are
                        hidden the multifarious forces which, under certain favorable conditions,
                        result in organization. Magnify this infinitesimal atom a thousand times,
                        and no congeries of formative powers is perceived wherewith to work out the
                        wonders of its existence. Yet it contains the principle, which is the
                        contribution on the part of the male toward the generation of a new
                        being.</p>
                    <p>The <emph>ovum</emph> or germ-cell, is the special contribution on the part
                        of the female for the production of another being. The human ovum, though
                        larger than the spermatozooen, is also extremely small, measuring not more
                        than from 1/20 to 1/10 of a line, or from 1/240 to 1/120 of an inch, in
                        diameter.</p>

                    <p>The sperm and the germ-cells contain the primary elements of all organic
                        structures, and both possess the special qualities and conditions by which
                        they may evolve organic beings. Every cell is composed of minute grains,
                        within which vital action takes place. The interior of a cell consists of
                        growing matter; the exterior, of matter which has assumed its form and is
                        less active.</p>
                    <p>When the vital principle is communicated to it, the cell undergoes a rapid
                        transformation. While this alteration takes place within the cell,
                        deteriorating changes occur in the cell-wall. Although vital operations
                        build up these structures, yet the animal and nervous functions are
                        continually disintegrating, or wasting, them.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the animal kingdom, germ-cells present the same external aspect
                        when carefully examined with the microscope. No difference can be observed
                        between the cells of the flowers of the oak and those of the apple, but the
                        cells of the one always produce oak trees, while those of the other always
                        produce apple trees. The same is true of the germs of animals, there being
                        not the slightest apparent difference. We are unable to perceive how one
                        cell should give origin to a dog, while another exactly like it becomes a
                        man. For aught we know, the ultimate atoms of these cells are identical in
                        physical character; at least we have no means of detecting any
                        difference.</p>
                    <p>SPECIES. The term species is generally used merely as a convenient name to
                        designate certain assemblages of individuals having various striking points
                        of resemblance. Scientific writers, as a rule, no longer hold that what are
                        usually called <emph>species</emph> are constantly unvarying and
                        unchangeable quantities. Recent researches point to the conclusion that
                            <emph>all species vary more or less</emph>, and, in some instances, that
                        the variation is so great that the limits of general specific distinctness
                        are sometimes exceeded.</p>
                    <p>Our space will not permit us to do more than merely indicate the two great
                        fundamental ideas upon which the leading theories of the time respecting the
                        origin of species are based. These are usually termed the doctrine of
                        _Special Creation_ and the doctrine of _Evolution_. According to the
                        doctrine of Special Creation, it is thought that species are practically
                        immutable productions, each species having a _specific centre_ where it was
                        originally created, and from which it spread over a certain area until its
                        further progress was obstructed by unfavorable conditions. The advocates of
                        the doctrine of Evolution hold, on the contrary, that species are not
                        permanent and immutable, but that they are subject to modification, and that
                        "the existing forms of life are descendants by true generation of
                        pre-existing forms."<noteref ref="n1">[1]</noteref> Most naturalists are now
                        inclined to admit the general truth of the theory of evolution, but they
                        differ widely respecting the mode in which it occurred.</p>

                        <h>THE PROCESS OF GENERATION.</h>
                        <p>The vital <emph>principle</emph>, represented in the
                            <emph>sperm</emph>-cell by a spermatozooen, must be imparted to a
                                <emph>germ</emph>-cell in order to effect impregnation. After
                            touching each other, separate them immediately, and observe the result.
                            If, with the aid of a powerful lens, we directly examine the
                            spermatozooen, it will be perceived that, for a short time, it preserves
                            its dimensions and retains all its material aspects. But it does not
                            long withstand the siege of decay, and, having fulfilled its destiny,
                            loses its organic characteristics, and begins to shrink.</p>
                        <p>If we examine the fertilized germ, we discover unusual activity, the
                            result of impregnation. Organic processes succeed one another with
                            wonderful regularity, as if wrought out by inexplicable intelligence.
                            Here begin the functions which constitute human physiology.</p>
                        <p>Generation requires that a spermatozooen be brought into actual contact
                            with a germ that fecundation may follow. If a spermatic cell, or
                            spermatozooen, together with several unimpregnated ova, no matter how
                            near to one another, if not actually touching, be placed on the concave
                            surface of a watch-crystal, and covered with another crystal, keeping
                            them warm, and even though the vapor of the ova envelops it, no
                            impregnation will occur. Place the spermatozooen in contact with an
                            ovum, and impregnation is instantly and perfectly accomplished. Should
                            this vitalizing power be termed nerve-force, electricity, heat, or
                            motion? It is known that these forces may be metamorphosed; for
                            instance, nervous force may be converted into electricity, electricity
                            into heat, and heat into motion, thus illustrating their affiliation and
                            capability of transformation. But nothing is explained respecting the
                            real nature of the vital principle, if we assert its identity with any
                            of these forces; for who can reveal the true nature of any of these, or
                            even of matter?</p>

                        <h>ALTERNATE GENERATION.</h>
                        <p>In several insect families, the species is not wholly represented in the
                            adult individuals of both sexes, or in their development, but, to
                            complete this series, supplementary individuals, as it were, of one or
                            of several preceding generations, are required. The son may not resemble
                            the father, but the grandfather, and in some instances, the likeness
                            re-appears only in latter generations. Agassiz states: "Alternate
                            generation was first observed among the Salpae. These are marine
                            mollusks, without shells, belonging to the family Tunicata. They are
                            distinguished by the curious peculiarity of being united together in
                            considerable numbers so as to form long chains, which float in the sea,
                            the mouth(<emph>m</emph>) however being free in each.</p>

                            but in each animal there is generally but one egg formed, which is
                            developed in the body of the parent, and from which is hatched a little
                            mollusk.</p>
                        <p>"Fig. 3, which remains solitary, and differs in many respects from the
                            parent. This little animal, on the other hand, does not produce eggs,
                            but propagates, by a kind of budding, which gives rise to chains already
                            seen in the body of their parent(a), and these again bring forth
                            solitary individuals, etc."</p>
                        <p>It therefore follows that generation in some animals require? two
                            different bodies with intermediate ones, by means of which and their
                            different modes of reproduction, a return to the original stock is
                            effected.</p>
                        <p>UNIVERSALITY OF ANIMALCULAR LIFE.--Living organisms are universally
                            diffused over every part of the globe. The gentle zephyr wafts from
                            flower to flower invisible, fructifying atoms, which quicken beauty and
                            fragrance, giving the promise of a golden fruitage, to gladden and
                            nourish a dependent world. Nature's own sweet cunning invests all living
                            things constraining into her service chemical affinities, arranging the
                            elements and disposing them for her own benefit, in such numberless ways
                            that we involuntarily exclaim, <quote>"The course of Nature is the art
                                of God."</quote> The microscope reveals the fact that matter
                            measuring only 1/120000 of an inch diameter may be endowed with
                            vitality, and that countless numbers of animalcules often inhabit a
                            single drop of stagnant water. These monads do not vary in form, whether
                            in motion or at rest. The life of one, even, is an inexplicable mystery
                            to the philosopher. Ehrenberg writes: "Not only in the polar regions is
                            there an uninterrupted development of active microscopic life, where
                            larger animals cannot exist, but we find that those minute beings
                            collected in the Antarctic expedition of Captain James Ross exhibit a
                            remarkable abundance of unknown, and often most beautiful forms."</p>
                        <p>Even the interior of animal bodies is inhabited by animalcules. They have
                            been found in the blood of the frog and the salmon, and in the optic
                            fluid of fishes. Organic beings are found in the interior of the earth,
                            into which the industry of the miner has made extensive excavations,
                            sunk deep shafts, and thus revealed their forms; likewise, the smallest
                            fossil organisms form subterranean strata many fathoms deep. Not only do
                            lakes and inland seas abound with life, but also, from unknown depths,
                            in volcanic districts, arise thermal springs which contain living
                            insects. Were we endowed with a microscopic eye, we might see myriads of
                            ethereal voyagers wafted by on every breeze, as we now behold drifting
                            clouds of aqueous vapor. While the continents of earth furnishes
                            evidences of the universality of organic beings, recent observations
                            prove that "animal life predominates amid the eternal night of the
                            depths of the liquid ocean."</p>

                        <h>THE ORIGIN OF LIFE.</h>
                        <p>The ancients, rude in many of their ideas, referred the origin of life to
                            divine determination. The thought was crudely expressed, but well
                            represented, in the following verse:</p>
                        <poem>
                            <l>"Then God smites his hands together,</l>
                            <l>And strikes out a soul as a spark,</l>
                            <l>Into the organized glory of things.</l>
                            <l>From the deeps of the dark."</l>
                        </poem>
                        <p>According to a Greek myth, Prometheus formed a human image from the dust
                            of the ground, and then, by fire stolen from heaven, animated it with a
                            living soul. Spontaneous generation once held its sway, and now the idea
                            of natural evolution is popular. Some believe that the inpenetrable
                            mystery of life is evolved from the endowments of nature, and build
                            their imperfect theory on observations of her concrete forms and their
                            manifestations, to which all our investigations are restricted. But
                            every function indicates purpose, every organism evinces intelligent
                            design, and <emph>all</emph> proclaim a Divine Power. Something cannot
                            come out of nothing. With reason and philosophy, <emph>chance</emph> is
                            an impossibility. We, therefore, accept the display of wisdom in nature
                            as indicative of the designs of God. Thus "has He written His claims for
                            our profoundest admiration and homage all over every object that He has
                            made." If you ask: Is there any advantage in considering the phenomena
                            of nature as the result of DIVINE VOLITION? we answer, that this belief
                            corresponds with the universally acknowledged ideas of accountability;
                            for, with a wise, and efficient Cause, we infer there is an intelligent
                            creation, and the desire to communicate, guide and bless, is responded
                            to by man, who loves, obeys, and enjoys. Nothing is gained by
                            attributing to nature vicegerent forces. Is it not preferable to say
                            that she responds to intelligent, loving Omnipotence? Our finiteness is
                            illustrated by our initiation into organized being. Emerging from a
                            rayless atom, too diminutive for the sight, we gradually develop and
                            advance to the maturity of those <emph>conscious powers</emph>, the
                            exercise of which furnishes indubitable evidence of our immortality. We
                            are pervaded with invisible influences, which, like the needle of the
                            compass trembling on its pivot, point us to immortality as our ultimate
                            goal, where in the sunny clime of Love, even in a spiritual realm of joy
                            and happiness, we may eternally reign with Him who is all in all.</p>
