            <p>For markup of a printed book, it is often useful or neccesary to retain information
                about where in the text the actual pagebreaks occur. The <span class="markup"
                    >pagebreak</span> element can be used for this purpose. </p>
            <p> The optional <span class="markup">value</span> attribute can be used to hold
                information about the page number of the page following the pagebreak. Note that
                this attribute may contain any string, not just an arabic number.</p>
            <h2>Examples</h2>
            <h3>Example 1</h3>
            <pre>
                &lt;p&gt;
                "He has never since been what he might have been," said Mr. Jarndyce, "and now you
                see him in his age with no one near him &lt;d:pagebreak /&gt;but his servant and his little yellow 
                friend.  It's your throw, my dear!"
                &lt;/p&gt;
            </pre>
            <h3>Example 2</h3>
            <pre>
                &lt;p&gt;
                &lt;d:s&gt;Mr. Guppy went down on his knees.&lt;/d:s&gt;
                &lt;d:s&gt;I was well behind my table and not much frightened.&lt;/d:s&gt;
                &lt;d:pagebreak value="176" /&gt;
                &lt;d:s&gt;I said, "Get up from that ridiculous position immediately, sir, or you
                will oblige me to break my implied promise and ring the bell!".&lt;/d:s&gt;
                &lt;/p&gt;
            </pre>
            <h3>Example 3</h3>
            <pre>
                &lt;p&gt;He looked piteously, but slowly rose and did so.&lt;/p&gt;
                &lt;d:pagebreak value="22" /&gt;
                &lt;p&gt;"Yet what a mockery it is, miss," he said with his hand upon his heart and shaking
                his head at me in a melancholy manner over the tray, "to be stationed behind food at
                such a moment.  The soul recoils from food at such a moment, miss."&lt;/p&gt;
