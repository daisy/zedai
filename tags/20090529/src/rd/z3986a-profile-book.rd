    <p>The Z39.86-2010 Book Profile is intended to serve as an XML republishing format for
        <strong>print books</strong>.</p>

    <p>This profile can be used for markup of a wide variety of print books.
    It is suitable both for those with simple structure, such as novels or children's books, and
    for very complex books with specialized structures, such as student textbooks and technical books.</p>
    
    <p>Among its many features, the book profile includes markup definitions to handle such structures as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>sections and section headings</li>
      <li>page breaks</li>
      <li>various types of lists</li>
      <li>tables</li>
      <li>various types of notes and annotations</li>
      <li>tables of content and other specialized front matter structures</li>
      <li>images and other media objects</li>
      <li>book covers</li>
      <li>mathematics (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>)</li>
      <li>printed forms (<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">XForms</a>)</li>
