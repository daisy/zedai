    <section about="z3986.annotation">
        <para role="desc-main"> The {annotation} element represents an annotation that an author, editor,
            publisher, or other individual or agency has added to a document. </para>
        <para role="desc-sub">Unless an {annotation} element has a {[[#z3986.role.attrib]]} value of {temporary},
            it must reference at least one element in the document using the {[[#z3986.ref.attrib]]} attribute or be 
            referenced by at least one {[[#z3986.annoref]]}. For annotations that apply to more than one element, 
            use a space-separated list of {xml:id} values in the {ref} attribute.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The {[[#z3986.ref.attrib]]} attribute identifies the specific element(s)
            being annotated by referencing their {xml:id} values.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The {annotation} element should not be used to add descriptions, footnotes
            or endnotes. Refer to the {[[#z3986.description description]]} and  {[[#z3986.note]]} elements 
            for more information.

    <!--
                    CITATION
    -->

    <section about="z3986.citation">
        <para role="desc-main">The {citation} element represents an author's acknowledgment of the
            original author and/or work of a directly or indirectly borrowed idea, quote or other
            resource. Citations typically occur in conjunction with epigraphs, quotes,
            illustrations, charts and diagrams.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The optional {[[#z3986.ref.attrib]]} attribute on the {citation} element
            is used to establish an explicit association between the {citation} and the passage or resource
            it references; the placement of the {citation} does not, by default, imply an association with any 
            element in the document. Some elements do provide a mechanism for implied relationships, however
            (see the {[[#z3986.quote.block quote]]} element, for example). When adding citations, refer to the 
            documentation for the element the citation is being attached to for more information.
        </para>
        <para role="desc-sub">A {citation} can also be linked to the work it cites by including a
            child {[[#z3986.ref]]} element. A {[[#z3986.ref.attrib]]} attribute can be attached to the
            nested {ref} element to reference a work in the current document's
            {[[#z3986.bibliography]]}, for example. To reference other resources, including resources external to
            the current document, the {[[#xlink.href.attrib]]} attribute must be used
            instead.</para>
    </section>



    <!--
                    CODE
    -->

    <section about="z3986.code">
        <para role="desc-main"> The {code} element is intended for general instances of code as found in
            works of fiction and similar non-technical documents, which includes computer
            programming code, commands and command input/output as well as representations of
            numeric and text coding systems, such as Morse code. </para>
        <para role="desc-sub"> For computer programming books, manuals and specifications, specializing
            the {code} element or using a computer markup feature is recommended. </para>
    </section>




    <!--
                    CUSTOM-CONTENT
    -->

    <section about="z3986.custom-content">
        <para role="desc-sub"> The republishing of documents often requires the insertion of content
            that was not a part of the original source document. For example, in the case of
            indexes, bibliographies and other ordered sections, this requirement may take the form
            of placeholder sections to mark gaps in the alphabetic list of entries. To indicate that
            an element presents content that is a deviation from the source, the
            {[[#z3986.role.attrib]]} attribute can be used with the value {custom}. No behaviors are
            defined for how a processing agent should handle sections so identified, however.

    <section about="z3986.description">
        <para role="desc-main">The {description} element represents an alternate accessible description of an image, video, table, etc.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The {description} element can either contain the text content of the description or reference an external file in which it can be found via the {[[#xlink.href.attrib]]} attribute. It is not permitted to mix both methods, however.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The {description} element does not allow elements and attributes from features to ensure the ability to render the description.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub absdef-only">If altering the content model of the element during activation, profile creators must not allow elements from any features as some processors may ignore the elements.</para>

        <para role="desc-main">The {emph} element represents an author's emphasis.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">Emphasis is not restricted to italicized text, but may constitute any of a variety of typographical or styling means used to distinguish text, such as bolding, underlining, coloring, etc.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">Nested {emph} elements indicate extra emphasized segments within an emphasized segment.</para>

        <para role="desc-main"> The {item} element represents a single item in a list. </para>
        <para role="desc-sub">
            The number or glyph that appears before the {item} is typically controlled by the attributes specified
            on the parent {[[#z3986.list list]]} element together with the number of preceding {item}s.
            The Content Rendition feature's 
            {[[http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2011/auth/features/rend/current/#z3986.rend.list.item.prefix.attrib prefix]]} 
            attribute allows this default behaviour to be overridden for individual items, however.

            unordered. </para>
        <para role="desc-sub"> The optional {type} attribute specifies the HTML-style ordered and
            unordered nature of the list.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub"> By default, an unordered list is prefixed by bullets and an ordered list
            by numeric values. To change this behavior, refer to the Content Rendition feature's 
            {[[http://www.daisy.org/z3986/2011/auth/features/rend/current/#z3986.rend.list.ordered.prefix.attrib prefix]]} 
            attributes. </para>
        <para role="desc-sub">If the {type} attribute is omitted, then there is no default
            formatting.</para>

            content, but its media type must be supported by the current profile and features in
            use. The optional {srctype} attribute carries an enumeration of the allowed media
            types.</para>
        <para role="desc-sub">The formal behavior of the {object} element is defined by

    <section about="z3986.quote">
        <para role="desc-main">The {quote} element represents a quotation from a real or fictitious
        source.</para>
        
        <para role="desc-sub"> If a {quote} element contains only
            a single child {citation} element, and the {citation} does not contain a {ref} attribute or child 
            {[[#z3986.ref]]} element, the association between the two elements is implied.</para>

        <para role="desc-sub">The {[[#z3986.role.attrib]]} attribute optionally expresses the semantic
            nature of the quote. The {role} value {epigraph}, for example, indicates the quoted
            passage or verse represents an epigraph for the document or section.</para>

    <section about="z3986.quote.characters">
        <para role="desc-sub"> Quotation marks should be included within the element if they must be
            retained in the file. The use of CSS for appending these characters is recommended,

        <para role="desc-sub">The {span} element is similar to the {[[#z3986.block]]} element in that only acts a container for its child content. It is a semantically neutral element by default, but may express some other commonality between the elements such as formatting or language.</para>
