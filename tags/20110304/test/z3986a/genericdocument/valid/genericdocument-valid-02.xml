    <h>Form W-4 (2009)</h>
    <section>
      <section>
        <h>Purpose.</h>
        <p>Complete Form W-4 so that your employer can withhold the correct federal income tax from
          your pay. Consider completing a new Form W-4 each year and when your personal or financial 
          situation changes.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Exemption from withholding.</h>
        <p>If you are exempt, complete <emph>only</emph> lines 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 and sign the form
          to validate it. Your exemption for 2009 expires February 16, 2010. See Pub. 505, Tax 
          Withholding and Estimated Tax.</p>
        <p><emph>Note.</emph> You cannot claim exemption from withholding if (a) your income exceeds
          $950 and includes more than $300 of unearned income (for example, interest and dividends) 
          and (b) another person can claim you as a dependent on their tax return.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Basic instructions.</h>
        <p>If you are not exempt, complete the <emph>Personal Allowances Worksheet</emph> below. The
          worksheets on page 2 further adjust your withholding allowances based on itemized deductions, 
          certain credits, adjustments to income, or two-earner/multiple job situations. Complete all 
          worksheets that apply. However, you may claim fewer (or zero) allowances. For regular wages, 
          withholding must be based on allowances you claimed and may not be a flat amount or 
          percentage of wages.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Head of household.</h>
        <p>Generally, you may claim head of household filing status on your tax return only if you
          are unmarried and pay more than 50% of the costs of keeping up a home for yourself and your 
          dependent(s) or other qualifying individuals. See Pub. 501, Exemptions, Standard Deduction, 
          and Filing Information, for information.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Tax credits.</h>
        <p>You can take projected tax credits into account in figuring your allowable number of
          withholding allowances. Credits for child or dependent care expenses and the child tax credit 
          may be claimed using the <emph>Personal Allowances Worksheet</emph> below. See Pub. 919, How 
          Do I Adjust My Tax Withholding, for information on converting your other credits into 
          withholding allowances.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Nonwage income.</h>
        <p>If you have a large amount of nonwage income, such as interest or dividends, consider
          making estimated tax payments using Form 1040-ES, Estimated Tax for Individuals. Otherwise, 
          you may owe additional tax. If you have pension or annuity income, see Pub. 919 to find out 
          if you should adjust your withholding on Form W-4 or W-4P.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Two earners or multiple jobs.</h>
        <p>If you have a working spouse or more than one job, figure the total number of allowances
          you are entitled to claim on all jobs using worksheets from only one Form W-4. Your 
          withholding usually will be most accurate when all allowances are claimed on the Form W-4 
          for the highest paying job and zero allowances are claimed on the others. See Pub. 919 for 
          details.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Nonresident alien.</h>
        <p>If you are a nonresident alien, see the Instructions for Form 8233 before completing this
          Form W-4.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h>Check your withholding.</h>
        <p>After your Form W-4 takes effect, use Pub. 919 to see how the amount you are having
          withheld compares to your projected total tax for 2009. See Pub. 919, especially if your 
          earnings exceed $130,000 (Single) or $180,000 (Married).</p>
