                    But with regard to the material world, we can at least go so far as this— we
                    can perceive that events are brought about not by insulated interpositions
                    of Divine power, exerted in each particular case, but by the establishment
                    of general laws.

                    To conclude, therefore, let no man out of a weak conceit of sobriety, or an
                    ill-applied moderation, think or maintain, that a man can search too far or
                    be too well studied in the book of God's word, or in the book of God's
                    works; divinity or philosophy; but rather let men endeavour an endless
                    progress or proficience in both.

                    <h>INTRODUCTION.</h>
                    <p>WHEN on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I was much struck with certain
                        facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of South America, and in the
                        geological relations of the present to the past inhabitants of that
                        continent. These facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of
                        species—that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our
                        greatest philosophers. On my return home, it occurred to me, in 1837, that
                        something might perhaps be made out on this question by patiently
                        accumulating and reflecting on all sorts of facts which could possibly have
                        any bearing on it. After five years' work I allowed myself to speculate on
                        the subject, and drew up some short notes; these I enlarged in
                            <time>1844</time> into a sketch of the conclusions, which then seemed to
                        me probable: from that period to the present day I have steadily pursued the
                        same object. I hope that I may be excused for entering on these personal
                        details, as I give them to show that I have not been hasty in coming to a
                        decision.</p>
                    <p>My work is now nearly finished; but as it will take me two or three more
                        years to complete it, and as my health is far from strong, I have been urged
                        to publish this Abstract. I have more especially been induced to do this, as
                            <name>Mr. Wallace</name>, who is now studying the <pagebreak value="p2"
                        /> natural history of the Malay archipelago, has arrived at almost exactly
                        the same general conclusions that I have on the origin of species. Last year
                        he sent to me a memoir on this subject, with a request that I would forward
                        it to <name>Sir Charles Lyell</name>, who sent it to the Linnean Society,
                        and it is published in the third volume of the Journal of that Society.
                            <name>Sir C. Lyell</name> and <name>Dr. Hooker</name>, who both knew of
                        my work—the latter having read my sketch of <time>1844</time>—honoured me by
                        thinking it advisable to publish, with <name>Mr. Wallace</name>'s excellent
                        memoir, some brief extracts from my manuscripts. </p>
                    <p>This Abstract, which I now publish, must necessarily be imperfect. I cannot
                        here give references and authorities for my several statements; and I must
                        trust to the reader reposing some confidence in my accuracy. No doubt errors
                        will have crept in, though I hope I have always been cautious in trusting to
                        good authorities alone. I can here give only the general conclusions at
                        which I have arrived, with a few facts in illustration, but which, I hope,
                        in most cases will suffice. No one can feel more sensible than I do of the
                        necessity of hereafter publishing in detail all the facts, with references,
                        on which my conclusions have been grounded; and I hope in a future work to
                        do this. For I am well aware that scarcely a single point is discussed in
                        this volume on which facts cannot be adduced, often apparently leading to
                        conclusions directly opposite to those at which I have arrived. A fair
                        result can be obtained only by fully stating and balancing the facts and
                        arguments on both sides of each question; and this cannot possibly be here
                        done.</p>
                    <p> I much regret that want of space prevents my having the satisfaction of
                        acknowledging the generous assistance which I have received from very many
                        naturalists, some of them personally unknown to me. I cannot, however,
                            <pagebreak value="p3"/> let this opportunity pass without expressing my
                        deep obligations to Dr. Hooker, who for the last fifteen years has aided me
                        in every possible way by his large stores of knowledge and his excellent
                        judgment. </p>
                    <p>In considering the Origin of Species, it is quite conceivable that a
                        naturalist, reflecting on the mutual affinities of organic beings, on their
                        embryological relations, their geographical distribution, geological
                        succession, and other such facts, might come to the conclusion that each
                        species had not been independently created, but had descended, like
                        varieties, from other species. Nevertheless, such a conclusion, even if well
                        founded, would be unsatisfactory, until it could be shown how the
                        innumerable species inhabiting this world have been modified, so as to
                        acquire that perfection of structure and coadaptation which most justly
                        excites our admiration. Naturalists continually refer to external
                        conditions, such as climate, food, &amp;c., as the only possible cause
                        of variation. In one very limited sense, as we shall hereafter see, this may
                        be true; but it is preposterous to attribute to mere external conditions,
                        the structure, for instance, of the woodpecker, with its feet, tail, beak,
                        and tongue, so admirably adapted to catch insects under the bark of trees.
                        In the case of the misseltoe, which draws its nourishment from certain
                        trees, which has seeds that must be transported by certain birds, and which
                        has flowers with separate sexes absolutely requiring the agency of certain
                        insects to bring pollen from one flower to the other, it is equally
                        preposterous to account for the structure of this parasite, with its
                        relations to several distinct organic beings, by the effects of external
                        conditions, or of habit, or of the volition of the plant itself.</p>
                    <p> The author of the '<span role="biblioref">Vestiges of Creation</span>'
                        would, I presume, say that, after a certain unknown number of <pagebreak
                            value="p4"/> generations, some bird had given birth to a woodpecker, and
                        some plant to the misseltoe, and that these had been produced perfect as we
                        now see them; but this assumption seems to me to be no explanation, for it
                        leaves the case of the coadaptations of organic beings to each other and to
                        their physical conditions of life, untouched and unexplained. </p>
                    <p>It is, therefore, of the highest importance to gain a clear insight into the
                        means of modification and coadaptation. At the commencement of my
                        observations it seemed to me probable that a careful study of domesticated
                        animals and of cultivated plants would offer the best chance of making out
                        this obscure problem. Nor have I been disappointed; in this and in all other
                        perplexing cases I have invariably found that our knowledge, imperfect
                        though it be, of variation under domestication, afforded the best and safest
                        clue. I may venture to express my conviction of the high value of such
                        studies, although they have been very commonly neglected by naturalists.</p>
                    <p>From these considerations, I shall devote the first chapter of this Abstract
                        to Variation under Domestication. We shall thus see that a large amount of
                        hereditary modification is at least possible, and, what is equally or more
                        important, we shall see how great is the power of man in accumulating by his
                        Selection successive slight variations. I will then pass on to the
                        variability of species in a state of nature; but I shall, unfortunately, be
                        compelled to treat this subject far too briefly, as it can be treated
                        properly only by giving long catalogues of facts. We shall, however, be
                        enabled to discuss what circumstances are most favourable to variation. In
                        the next chapter the Struggle for Existence amongst all organic beings
                        throughout the world, which inevitably follows from their high geometrical
                        powers of <pagebreak xml:id="p5" value="5"/> increase, will be treated of.
                        This is the doctrine of Malthus, applied to the whole animal and vegetable
                        kingdoms. As many more individuals of each species are born than can
                        possibly survive; and as, consequently, there is a frequently recurring
                        struggle for existence, it follows that any being, if it vary however
                        slightly in any manner profitable to itself, under the complex and sometimes
                        varying conditions of life, will have a better chance of surviving, and thus
                        be <emph>naturally selected</emph>. From the strong principle of
                        inheritance, any selected variety will tend to propagate its new and
                        modified form.</p>
                    <p>This fundamental subject of Natural Selection will be treated at some length
                        in the fourth chapter; and we shall then see how Natural Selection almost
                        inevitably causes much <term>Extinction</term> of the less improved forms of
                        life, and induces what I have called <term>Divergence of Character</term>.
                        In the next chapter I shall discuss the complex and little known laws of
                        variation and of correlation of growth. In the four succeeding chapters, the
                        most apparent and gravest difficulties on the theory will be given: namely,
                        first, the difficulties of transitions, or in understanding how a simple
                        being or a simple organ can be changed and perfected into a highly developed
                        being or elaborately constructed organ; secondly, the subject of
                            <term>Instinct</term>, or the mental powers of animals; thirdly,
                            <term>Hybridism</term>, or the infertility of species and the fertility
                        of varieties when intercrossed; and fourthly, the imperfection of the
                        Geological Record. In the next chapter I shall consider the geological
                        succession of organic beings throughout time; in the eleventh and twelfth,
                        their geographical distribution throughout space; in the thirteenth, their
                        classification or mutual affinities, both when mature and in an embryonic
                        condition. In the last chapter I shall give a <pagebreak xml:id="p6"
                            value="6"/> brief recapitulation of the whole work, and a few concluding
                        remarks.</p>
                    <p>No one ought to feel surprise at much remaining as yet unexplained in regard
                        to the origin of species and varieties, if he makes due allowance for our
                        profound ignorance in regard to the mutual relations of all the beings which
                        live around us. Who can explain why one species ranges widely and is very
                        numerous, and why another allied species has a narrow range and is rare? Yet
                        these relations are of the highest importance, for they determine the
                        present welfare, and, as I believe, the future success and modification of
                        every inhabitant of this world. Still less do we know of the mutual
                        relations of the innumerable inhabitants of the world during the many past
                        geological epochs in its history. Although much remains obscure, and will
                        long remain obscure, I can entertain no doubt, after the most deliberate
                        study and dispassionate judgment of which I am capable, that the view which
                        most naturalists entertain, and which I formerly entertained—namely, that
                        each species has been independently created—is erroneous. I am fully
                        convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what
                        are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and
                        generally extinct species, in the same manner as the acknowledged varieties
                        of any one species are the descendants of that species. Furthermore, I am
                        convinced that Natural Selection has been the main but not exclusive means
                        of modification.</p>

                    <p>WHEN we look to the individuals of the same variety or sub-variety of our
                        older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes
                        us, is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do the
                        individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature. When we
                        reflect on the vast diversity of the plants and animals which have been
                        cultivated, and which have varied during all ages under the most different
                        climates and treatment, I think we are driven to conclude that this greater
                        variability is simply due to our domestic productions having been raised
                        under conditions of life not so uniform as, and somewhat different from,
                        those to which the parent-species have been exposed under nature. There is,
                        also, I think, some probability in the view propounded by Andrew Knight,
                        that this variability may be partly connected with excess of food. It seems
                        pretty clear that organic beings must be exposed during several generations
                        to the new conditions of life to cause any appreciable amount of variation;
                        and that when the organisation has once begun to vary, it generally
                        continues to vary for many generations.</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p8" value="8"/>
                    <p>No case is on record of a variable being ceasing to be variable under
                        cultivation. Our oldest cultivated plants, such as wheat, still often yield
                        new varieties: our oldest domesticated animals are still capable of rapid
                        improvement or modification.</p>
                    <p>It has been disputed at what period of life the causes of variability,
                        whatever they may be, generally act; whether during the early or late period
                        of development of the embryo, or at the instant of conception. Geoffroy St.
                        Hilaire's experiments show that unnatural treatment of the embryo causes
                        monstrosities; and monstrosities cannot be separated by any clear line of
                        distinction from mere variations. But I am strongly inclined to suspect that
                        the most frequent cause of variability may be attributed to the male and
                        female reproductive elements having been affected prior to the act of
                        conception. Several reasons make me believe in this; but the chief one is
                        the remarkable effect which confinement or cultivation has on the functions
                        of the reproductive system; this system appearing to be far more susceptible
                        than any other part of the organisation, to the action of any change in the
                        conditions of life. Nothing is more easy than to tame an animal, and few
                        things more difficult than to get it to breed freely under confinement, even
                        in the many cases when the male and female unite. How many animals there are
                        which will not breed, though living long under not very close confinement in
                        their native country! This is generally attributed to vitiated instincts;
                        but how many cultivated plants display the utmost vigour, and yet rarely or
                        never seed! In some few such cases it has been found out that very trifling
                        changes, such as a little more or less water at some particular period of
                        growth, will determine whether or not the plant sets a seed. I cannot here
                        enter on the copious details which I have collected on <pagebreak
                            xml:id="p9" value="9"/> this curious subject; but to show how singular
                        the laws are which determine the reproduction of animals under confinement,
                        I may just mention that carnivorous animals, even from the tropics, breed in
                        this country pretty freely under confinement, with the exception of the
                        plantigrades or bear family; whereas, carnivorous birds, with the rarest
                        exceptions, hardly ever lay fertile eggs. Many exotic plants have pollen
                        utterly worthless, in the same exact condition as in the most sterile
                        hybrids. When, on the one hand, we see domesticated animals and plants,
                        though often weak and sickly, yet breeding quite freely under confinement;
                        and when, on the other hand, we see individuals, though taken young from a
                        state of nature, perfectly tamed, long-lived, and healthy (of which I could
                        give numerous instances), yet having their reproductive system so seriously
                        affected by unperceived causes as to fail in acting, we need not be
                        surprised at this system, when it does act under confinement, acting not
                        quite regularly, and producing offspring not perfectly like their parents or
                        variable.</p>
                    <p>Sterility has been said to be the bane of horticulture; but on this view we
                        owe variability to the same cause which produces sterility; and variability
                        is the source of all the choicest productions of the garden. I may add, that
                        as some organisms will breed most freely under the most unnatural conditions
                        (for instance, the rabbit and ferret kept in hutches), showing that their
                        reproductive system has not been thus affected; so will some animals and
                        plants withstand domestication or cultivation, and vary very
                        slightly—perhaps hardly more than in a state of nature.</p>
                    <p>A long list could easily be given of "sporting plants;" by this term
                        gardeners mean a single bud or offset, which suddenly assumes a new and
                        sometimes very different character from that of the rest of the plant.</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p10" value="10"/>
                    <p>Such buds can be propagated by grafting, &amp;c., and sometimes by seed.
                        These "sports" are extremely rare under nature, but far from rare under
                        cultivation; and in this case we see that the treatment of the parent has
                        affected a bud or offset, and not the ovules or pollen. But it is the
                        opinion of most physiologists that there is no essential difference between
                        a bud and an ovule in their earliest stages of formation; so that, in fact,
                        "sports" support my view, that variability may be largely attributed to the
                        ovules or pollen, or to both, having been affected by the treatment of the
                        parent prior to the act of conception. These cases anyhow show that
                        variation is not necessarily connected, as some authors have supposed, with
                        the act of generation.</p>
                    <p>Seedlings from the same fruit, and the young of the same litter, sometimes
                        differ considerably from each other, though both the young and the parents,
                        as MÃ¼ller has remarked, have apparently been exposed to exactly the same
                        conditions of life; and this shows how unimportant the direct effects of the
                        conditions of life are in comparison with the laws of reproduction, and of
                        growth, and of inheritance; for had the action of the conditions been
                        direct, if any of the young had varied, all would probably have varied in
                        the same manner. To judge how much, in the case of any variation, we should
                        attribute to the direct action of heat, moisture, light, food, &amp;c.,
                        is most difficult: my impression is, that with animals such agencies have
                        produced very little direct effect, though apparently more in the case of
                        plants. Under this point of view, Mr. Buckman's recent experiments on plants
                        seem extremely valuable. When all or nearly all the individuals exposed to
                        certain conditions are affected in the same way, the change at first appears
                        to be directly due to such conditions; but in some cases it can be shown
                        that quite opposite conditions produce <pagebreak xml:id="p11" value="11"/>
                        similar changes of structure. Nevertheless some slight amount of change may,
                        I think, be attributed to the direct action of the conditions of life—as, in
                        some cases, increased size from amount of food, colour from particular kinds
                        of food and from light, and perhaps the thickness of fur from climate.</p>
                    <p>Habit also has a decided influence, as in the period of flowering with plants
                        when transported from one climate to another. In animals it has a more
                        marked effect; for instance, I find in the domestic duck that the bones of
                        the wing weigh less and the bones of the leg more, in proportion to the
                        whole skeleton, than do the same bones in the wild-duck; and I presume that
                        this change may be safely attributed to the domestic duck flying much less,
                        and walking more, than its wild parent. The great and inherited development
                        of the udders in cows and goats in countries where they are habitually
                        milked, in comparison with the state of these organs in other countries, is
                        another instance of the effect of use. Not a single domestic animal can be
                        named which has not in some country drooping ears; and the view suggested by
                        some authors, that the drooping is due to the disuse of the muscles of the
                        ear, from the animals not being much alarmed by danger, seems probable.</p>
                    <p>There are many laws regulating variation, some few of which can be dimly
                        seen, and will be hereafter briefly mentioned. I will here only allude to
                        what may be called correlation of growth. Any change in the embryo or larva
                        will almost certainly entail changes in the mature animal. In monstrosities,
                        the correlations between quite distinct parts are very curious; and many
                        instances are given in Isidore Geoffroy St. Hilaire's great work on this
                        subject. Breeders believe that long limbs are almost always accompanied by
                        an elongated head. Some instances of correlation are quite whimsical: thus
                            <pagebreak xml:id="p12" value="12"/> cats with blue eyes are invariably
                        deaf; colour and constitutional peculiarities go together, of which many
                        remarkable cases could be given amongst animals and plants. From the facts
                        collected by <name xml:lang="de">Heusinger</name>, it appears that white
                        sheep and pigs are differently affected from coloured individuals by certain
                        vegetable poisons. Hairless dogs have imperfect teeth; long-haired and
                        coarse-haired animals are apt to have, as is asserted, long or many horns;
                        pigeons with feathered feet have skin between their outer toes; pigeons with
                        short beaks have small feet, and those with long beaks large feet. Hence, if
                        man goes on selecting, and thus augmenting, any peculiarity, he will almost
                        certainly unconsciously modify other parts of the structure, owing to the
                        mysterious laws of the correlation of growth.</p>
                    <p>The result of the various, quite unknown, or dimly seen laws of variation is
                        infinitely complex and diversified. It is well worth while carefully to
                        study the several treatises published on some of our old cultivated plants,
                        as on the hyacinth, potato, even the dahlia, &amp;c.; and it is really
                        surprising to note the endless points in structure and constitution in which
                        the varieties and sub-varieties differ slightly from each other. The whole
                        organisation seems to have become plastic, and tends to depart in some small
                        degree from that of the parental type.</p>
                    <p>Any variation which is not inherited is unimportant for us. But the number
                        and diversity of inheritable deviations of structure, both those of slight
                        and those of considerable physiological importance, is endless. Dr. Prosper
                        Lucas's treatise, in two large volumes, is the fullest and the best on this
                        subject. No breeder doubts how strong is the tendency to inheritance: like
                        produces like is his fundamental belief: doubts have been thrown on this
                        principle by theoretical writers alone. When a <pagebreak xml:id="p13"
                            value="13"/> deviation appears not unfrequently, and we see it in the
                        father and child, we cannot tell whether it may not be due to the same
                        original cause acting on both; but when amongst individuals, apparently
                        exposed to the same conditions, any very rare deviation, due to some
                        extraordinary combination of circumstances, appears in the parent—say, once
                        amongst several million individuals—and it reappears in the child, the mere
                        doctrine of chances almost compels us to attribute its reappearance to
                        inheritance. Every one must have heard of cases of albinism, prickly skin,
                        hairy bodies, &amp;c., appearing in several members of the same family.
                        If strange and rare deviations of structure are truly inherited, less
                        strange and commoner deviations may be freely admitted to be inheritable.
                        Perhaps the correct way of viewing the whole subject, would be, to look at
                        the inheritance of every character whatever as the rule, and non-inheritance
                        as the anomaly.</p>
                    <p>The laws governing inheritance are quite unknown; no one can say why the same
                        peculiarity in different individuals of the same species, and in individuals
                        of different species, is sometimes inherited and sometimes not so; why the
                        child often reverts in certain characters to its grandfather or grandmother
                        or other much more remote ancestor; why a peculiarity is often transmitted
                        from one sex to both sexes, or to one sex alone, more commonly but not
                        exclusively to the like sex. It is a fact of some little importance to us,
                        that peculiarities appearing in the males of our domestic breeds are often
                        transmitted either exclusively, or in a much greater degree, to males alone.
                        A much more important rule, which I think may be trusted, is that, at
                        whatever period of life a peculiarity first appears, it tends to appear in
                        the offspring at a corresponding age, though sometimes earlier. In many
                        cases this could <pagebreak xml:id="p14" value="14"/> not be otherwise: thus
                        the inherited peculiarities in the horns of cattle could appear only in the
                        offspring when nearly mature; peculiarities in the silkworm are known to
                        appear at the corresponding caterpillar or cocoon stage. But hereditary
                        diseases and some other facts make me believe that the rule has a wider
                        extension, and that when there is no apparent reason why a peculiarity
                        should appear at any particular age, yet that it does tend to appear in the
                        offspring at the same period at which it first appeared in the parent. I
                        believe this rule to be of the highest importance in explaining the laws of
                        embryology. These remarks are of course confined to the first
                            <emph>appearance</emph> of the peculiarity, and not to its primary
                        cause, which may have acted on the ovules or male element; in nearly the
                        same manner as in the crossed offspring from a short-horned cow by a
                        long-horned bull, the greater length of horn, though appearing late in life,
                        is clearly due to the male element.</p>
                    <p>Having alluded to the subject of reversion, I may here refer to a statement
                        often made by naturalists—namely, that our domestic varieties, when run
                        wild, gradually but certainly revert in character to their aboriginal
                        stocks. Hence it has been argued that no deductions can be drawn from
                        domestic races to species in a state of nature. I have in vain endeavoured
                        to discover on what decisive facts the above statement has so often and so
                        boldly been made. There would be great difficulty in proving its truth: we
                        may safely conclude that very many of the most strongly-marked domestic
                        varieties could not possibly live in a wild state. In many cases we do not
                        know what the aboriginal stock was, and so could not tell whether or not
                        nearly perfect reversion had ensued. It would be quite necessary, in order
                        to prevent the effects of intercrossing, that only a <pagebreak xml:id="p15"
                            value="15"/> single variety should be turned loose in its new home.
                        Nevertheless, as our varieties certainly do occasionally revert in some of
                        their characters to ancestral forms, it seems to me not improbable, that if
                        we could succeed in naturalising, or were to cultivate, during many
                        generations, the several races, for instance, of the cabbage, in very poor
                        soil (in which case, however, some effect would have to be attributed to the
                        direct action of the poor soil), that they would to a large extent, or even
                        wholly, revert to the wild aboriginal stock. Whether or not the experiment
                        would succeed, is not of great importance for our line of argument; for by
                        the experiment itself the conditions of life are changed. If it could be
                        shown that our domestic varieties manifested a strong tendency to
                        reversion,—that is, to lose their acquired characters, whilst kept under
                        unchanged conditions, and whilst kept in a considerable body, so that free
                        intercrossing might check, by blending together, any slight deviations of
                        structure, in such case, I grant that we could deduce nothing from domestic
                        varieties in regard to species. But there is not a shadow of evidence in
                        favour of this view: to assert that we could not breed our cart and
                        race-horses, long and short-horned cattle, and poultry of various breeds,
                        and esculent vegetables, for an almost infinite number of generations, would
                        be opposed to all experience. I may add, that when under nature the
                        conditions of life do change, variations and reversions of character
                        probably do occur; but natural selection, as will hereafter be explained,
                        will determine how far the new characters thus arising shall be
                        preserved.</p>
                    <p>When we look to the hereditary varieties or races of our domestic animals and
                        plants, and compare them with species closely allied together, we generally
                        perceive in each domestic race, as already remarked, less uniformity of
                        character than in true species. Domestic races of <pagebreak xml:id="p16"
                            value="16"/> the same species, also, often have a somewhat monstrous
                        character; by which I mean, that, although differing from each other, and
                        from the other species of the same genus, in several trifling respects, they
                        often differ in an extreme degree in some one part, both when compared one
                        with another, and more especially when compared with all the species in
                        nature to which they are nearest allied. With these exceptions (and with
                        that of the perfect fertility of varieties when crossed,—a subject hereafter
                        to be discussed), domestic races of the same species differ from each other
                        in the same manner as, only in most cases in a lesser degree than, do
                        closely-allied species of the same genus in a state of nature. I think this
                        must be admitted, when we find that there are hardly any domestic races,
                        either amongst animals or plants, which have not been ranked by some
                        competent judges as mere varieties, and by other competent judges as the
                        descendants of aboriginally distinct species. If any marked distinction
                        existed between domestic races and species, this source of doubt could not
                        so perpetually recur. It has often been stated that domestic races do not
                        differ from each other in characters of generic value. I think it could be
                        shown that this statement is hardly correct; but naturalists differ most
                        widely in determining what characters are of generic value; all such
                        valuations being at present empirical. Moreover, on the view of the origin
                        of genera which I shall presently give, we have no right to expect often to
                        meet with generic differences in our domesticated productions.</p>
                    <p>When we attempt to estimate the amount of structural difference between the
                        domestic races of the same species, we are soon involved in doubt, from not
                        knowing whether they have descended from one or several parent-species. This
                        point, if it could be cleared up, would be interesting; if, for instance, it
                        could be shown that the grey- <pagebreak xml:id="p17" value="17"/> hound,
                        bloodhound, terrier, spaniel, and bull-dog, which we all know propagate
                        their kind so truly, were the offspring of any single species, then such
                        facts would have great weight in making us doubt about the immutability of
                        the many very closely allied and natural species—for instance, of the many
                        foxes—inhabiting different quarters of the world. I do not believe, as we
                        shall presently see, that all our dogs have descended from any one wild
                        species; but, in the case of some other domestic races, there is
                        presumptive, or even strong, evidence in favour of this view.</p>
                    <p>It has often been assumed that man has chosen for domestication animals and
                        plants having an extraordinary inherent tendency to vary, and likewise to
                        withstand diverse climates. I do not dispute that these capacities have
                        added largely to the value of most of our domesticated productions; but how
                        could a savage possibly know, when he first tamed an animal, whether it
                        would vary in succeeding generations, and whether it would endure other
                        climates? Has the little variability of the ass or guinea-fowl, or the small
                        power of endurance of warmth by the rein-deer, or of cold by the common
                        camel, prevented their domestication? I cannot doubt that if other animals
                        and plants, equal in number to our domesticated productions, and belonging
                        to equally diverse classes and countries, were taken from a state of nature,
                        and could be made to breed for an equal number of generations under
                        domestication, they would vary on an average as largely as the parent
                        species of our existing domesticated productions have varied.</p>
                    <p>In the case of most of our anciently domesticated animals and plants, I do
                        not think it is possible to come to any definite conclusion, whether they
                        have descended from one or several species. The argument mainly relied on by
                        those who believe in the multiple origin <pagebreak xml:id="p18" value="18"
                        /> of our domestic animals is, that we find in the most ancient records,
                        more especially on the monuments of <name role="place">Egypt</name>, much diversity in
                        the breeds; and that some of the breeds closely resemble, perhaps are
                        identical with, those still existing. Even if this latter fact were found
                        more strictly and generally true than seems to me to be the case, what does
                        it show, but that some of our breeds originated there, four or five thousand
                        years ago? But <name>Mr. Horner</name>'s researches have rendered it in some
                        degree probable that man sufficiently civilized to have manufactured pottery
                        existed in the valley of the Nile thirteen or fourteen thousand years ago;
                        and who will pretend to say how long before these ancient periods, savages,
                        like those of <name role="place">Tierra del Fuego</name> or <name role="place">Australia</name>,
                        who possess a semi-domestic dog, may not have existed in
                            <name role="place">Egypt</name>?</p>
                    <p>The whole subject must, I think, remain vague; neverthelsss, I may, without
                        here entering on any details, state that, from geographical and other
                        considerations, I think it highly probable that our domestic dogs have
                        descended from several wild species. In regard to sheep and goats I can form
                        no opinion. I should think, from facts communicated to me by Mr. Blyth, on
                        the habits, voice, and constitution, &amp;c., of the humped Indian
                        cattle, that these had descended from a different aboriginal stock from our
                        European cattle; and several competent judges believe that these latter have
                        had more than one wild parent. With respect to horses, from reasons which I
                        cannot give here, I am doubtfully inclined to believe, in opposition to
                        several authors, that all the races have descended from one wild stock. Mr.
                        Blyth, whose opinion, from his large and varied stores of knowledge, I
                        should value more than that of almost any one, thinks that all the breeds of
                        poultry have proceeded from the common wild <pagebreak xml:id="p19"
                            value="19"/> Indian fowl (Gallus bankiva). In regard to ducks and
                        rabbits, the breeds of which differ considerably from each other in
                        structure, I do not doubt that they all have descended from the common wild
                        duck and rabbit.</p>
                    <p>The doctrine of the origin of our several domestic races from several
                        aboriginal stocks, has been carried to an absurd extreme by some authors.
                        They believe that every race which breeds true, let the distinctive
                        characters be ever so slight, has had its wild prototype. At this rate there
                        must have existed at least a score of species of wild cattle, as many sheep,
                        and several goats in Europe alone, and several even within Great Britain.
                        One author believes that there formerly existed in Great Britain eleven wild
                        species of sheep peculiar to it! When we bear in mind that Britain has now
                        hardly one peculiar mammal, and France but few distinct from those of
                        Germany and conversely, and so with Hungary, Spain, &amp;c., but that
                        each of these kingdoms possesses several peculiar breeds of cattle, sheep,
                        &amp;c., we must admit that many domestic breeds have originated in
                        Europe; for whence could they have been derived, as these several countries
                        do not possess a number of peculiar species as distinct parent-stocks? So it
                        is in India. Even in the case of the domestic dogs of the whole world, which
                        I fully admit have probably descended from several wild species, I cannot
                        doubt that there has been an immense amount of inherited variation. Who can
                        believe that animals closely resembling the Italian greyhound, the
                        bloodhound, the bull-dog, or Blenheim spaniel, &amp;c.—so unlike all
                        wild Canidœ—ever existed freely in a state of nature? It has often been
                        loosely said that all our races of dogs have been produced by the crossing
                        of a few aboriginal species; but by crossing we can get only forms in some
                        degree intermediate between their parents; and if we <pagebreak xml:id="p20"
                            value="20"/> account for our several domestic races by this process, we
                        must admit the former existence of the most extreme forms, as the Italian
                        greyhound, bloodhound, bull-dog, &amp;c., in the wild state. Moreover,
                        the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has been greatly
                        exaggerated. There can be no doubt that a race may be modified by occasional
                        crosses, if aided by the careful selection of those individual mongrels,
                        which present any desired character; but that a race could be obtained
                        nearly intermediate between two extremely different races or speceies, I can
                        hardly believe. Sir J. Sebright expressly experimentised for this object,
                        and failed. The offspring from the first cross between two pure breeds is
                        tolerably and sometimes (as I have found with pigeons) extremely uniform,
                        and everything seems simple enough; but when these mongrels are crossed one
                        with another for several generations, hardly two of them will be alike, and
                        then the extreme difficulty, or rather utter hopelessness, of the task
                        becomes apparent. Certainly, a breed intermediate between <emph>two very
                            distinct</emph> breeds could not be got without extreme care and
                        long-continued selection; nor can I find a single case on record of a
                        permanent race having been thus formed.</p>
                    <p><emph>On the Breeds of the Domestic Pigeon</emph>.—Believing that it is
                        always best to study some special group, I have, after deliberation, taken
                        up domestic pigeons. I have kept every breed which I could purchase or
                        obtain, and have been most kindly favoured with skins from several quarters
                        of the world, more especially by the Hon. W. Elliot from India, and by the
                        Hon. C. Murray from Persia. Many treatises in different languages have been
                        published on pigeons, and some of them are very important, as being of
                        considerable antiquity. I have associated with several eminent fanciers, and
                        have been permitted to join two <pagebreak xml:id="p21" value="21"/> of the
                        London Pigeon Clubs. The diversity of the breeds is something astonishing.
                        Compare the English carrier and the short-faced tumbler, and see the
                        wonderful difference in their beaks, entailing corresponding differences in
                        their skulls. The carrier, more especially the male bird, is also remarkable
                        from the wonderful development of the carunculated skin about the head, and
                        this is accompanied by greatly elongated eyelids, very large external
                        orifices to the nostrils, and a wide gape of mouth. The short-faced tumbler
                        has a beak in outline almost like that of a finch; and the common tumbler
                        has the singular and strictly inherited habit of flying at a great height in
                        a compact flock, and tumbling in the air head over heels. The runt is a bird
                        of great size, with long, massive beak and large feet; some of the
                        sub-breeds of runts have very long necks, others very long wings and tails,
                        others singularly short tails. The barb is allied to the carrier, but,
                        instead of a very long beak, has a very short and very broad one. The pouter
                        has a much elongated body, wings, and legs; and its enormously developed
                        crop, which it glories in inflating, may well excite astonishment and even
                        laughter. The turbit has a very short and conical beak, with a line of
                        reversed feathers down the breast; and it has the habit of continually
                        expanding slightly the upper part of the œsophagus. The Jacobin has the
                        feathers so much reversed along the back of the neck that they form a hood,
                        and it has, proportionally to its size, much elongated wing and tail
                        feathers. The trumpeter and laugher, as their names express, utter a very
                        different coo from the other breeds. The fantail has thirty or even forty
                        tail-feathers, instead of twelve or fourteen, the normal number in all
                        members of the great pigeon family; and these feathers are kept expanded,
                        and are carried so erect that in good birds the head and tail <pagebreak
                            xml:id="p22" value="22"/> touch; the oil-gland is quite aborted. Several
                        other less distinct breeds might have been specified.</p>
                    <p>In the skeletons of the several breeds, the development of the bones of the
                        face in length and breadth and curvature differs enormously. The shape, as
                        well as the breadth and length of the ramus of the lower jaw, varies in a
                        highly remarkable manner. The number of the caudal and sacral vertebrœ vary;
                        as does the number of the ribs, together with their relative breadth and the
                        presence of processes. The size and shape of the apertures in the sternum
                        are highly variable; so is the degree of divergence and relative size of the
                        two arms of the furcula. The proportional width of the gape of mouth, the
                        proportional length of the eyelids, of the orifice of the nostrils, of the
                        tongue (not always in strict correlation with the length of beak), the size
                        of the crop and of the upper part of the œsophagus; the development and
                        abortion of the oil-gland; the number of the primary wing and caudal
                        feathers; the relative length of wing and tail to each other and to the
                        body; the relative length of leg and of the feet; the number of scutellœ on
                        the toes, the development of skin between the toes, are all points of
                        structure which are variable. The period at which the perfect plumage is
                        acquired varies, as does the state of the down with which the nestling birds
                        are clothed when hatched. The shape and size of the eggs vary. The manner of
                        flight differs remarkably; as does in some breeds the voice and disposition.
                        Lastly, in certain breeds, the males and females have come to differ to a
                        slight degree from each other.</p>
                    <p>Altogether at least a score of pigeons might be chosen, which if shown to an
                        ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly,
                        I think, be ranked by him as well-defined species. Moreover, I do not
                        believe that any ornithologist would place</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p23" value="23"/>
                    <p>the English carrier, the short-faced tumbler, the runt, the barb, pouter, and
                        fantail in the same genus; more especially as in each of these breeds
                        several truly-inherited sub-breeds, or species as he might have called them,
                        could be shown him.</p>
                    <p>Great as the differences are between the breeds of pigeons, I am fully
                        convinced that the common opinion of naturalists is correct, namely, that
                        all have descended from the rock-pigeon (Columba livia), including under
                        this term several geographical races or sub-species, which differ from each
                        other in the most trifling respects. As several of the reasons which have
                        led me to this belief are in some degree applicable in other cases, I will
                        here briefly give them. If the several breeds are not varieties, and have
                        not proceeded from the rock-pigeon, they must have descended from at least
                        seven or eight aboriginal stocks; for it is impossible to make the present
                        domestic breeds by the crossing of any lesser number: how, for instance,
                        could a pouter be produced by crossing two breeds unless one of the
                        parent-stocks possessed the characteristic enormous crop? The supposed
                        aboriginal stocks must all have been rock-pigeons, that is, not breeding or
                        willingly perching on trees. But besides <name xml:lang="la">C.
                        livia</name>, with its geographical sub-species, only two or three other
                        species of rock-pigeons are known; and these have not any of the characters
                        of the domestic breeds. Hence the supposed aboriginal stocks must either
                        still exist in the countries where they were originally domesticated, and
                        yet be unknown to ornithologists; and this, considering their size, habits,
                        and remarkable characters, seems very improbable; or they must have become
                        extinct in the wild state. But birds breeding on precipices, and good
                        fliers, are unlikely to be exterminated; and the common rock-pigeon, which
                        has the same habits with the domestic breeds, has not been exterminated
                            <pagebreak xml:id="p24" value="24"/> even on several of the smaller
                        British islets, or on the shores of the Mediterranean. Hence the supposed
                        extermination of so many species having similar habits with the rock-pigeon
                        seems to me a very rash assumption. Moreover, the several above-named
                        domesticated breeds have been transported to all parts of the world, and,
                        therefore, some of them must have been carried back again into their native
                        country; but not one has ever become wild or feral, though the
                        dovecot-pigeon, which is the rock-pigeon in a very slightly altered state,
                        has become feral in several places. Again, all recent experience shows that
                        it is most difficult to get any wild animal to breed freely under
                        domestication; yet on the hypothesis of the multiple origin of our pigeons,
                        it must be assumed that at least seven or eight species were so thoroughly
                        domesticated in ancient times by half-civilized man, as to be quite prolific
                        under confinement.</p>
                    <p>An argument, as it seems to me, of great weight, and applicable in several
                        other cases, is, that the above-specified breeds, though agreeing generally
                        in constitution, habits, voice, colouring, and in most parts of their
                        structure, with the wild rock-pigeon, yet are certainly highly abnormal in
                        other parts of their structure: we may look in vain throughout the whole
                        great family of Columbidœ for a beak like that of the English carrier, or
                        that of the short-faced tumbler, or barb; for reversed feathers like those
                        of the jacobin; for a crop like that of the pouter; for tail-feathers like
                        those of the fantail. Hence it must be assumed not only that half-civilized
                        man succeeded in thoroughly domesticating several species, but that he
                        intentionally or by chance picked out extraordinarily abnormal species; and
                        further, that these very species have since all become extinct or unknown.
                        So many strange contingencies seem to me improbable in the highest
                        degree.</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p25" value="25"/>
                    <p>Some facts in regard to the colouring of pigeons well deserve consideration.
                        The rock-pigeon is of a slaty-blue, and has a white rump (the Indian
                        sub-species, <name xml:lang="la">C. intermedia</name> of Strickland, having
                        it bluish); the tail has a terminal dark bar, with the bases of the outer
                        feathers externally edged with white; the wings have two black bars; some
                        semi-domestic breeds and some apparently truly wild breeds have, besides the
                        two black bars, the wings chequered with black. These several marks do not
                        occur together in any other species of the whole family. Now, in every one
                        of the domestic breeds, taking thoroughly well-bred birds, all the above
                        marks, even to the white edging of the outer tail-feathers, sometimes concur
                        perfectly developed. Moreover, when two birds belonging to two distinct
                        breeds are crossed, neither of which is blue or has any of the
                        above-specified marks, the mongrel offspring are very apt suddenly to
                        acquire these characters; for instance, I crossed some uniformly white
                        fantails with some uniformly black barbs, and they produced mottled brown
                        and black birds; these I again crossed together, and one grandchild of the
                        pure white fantail and pure black barb was of as beautiful a blue colour,
                        with the white rump, double black wing-bar, and barred and white-edged
                        tail-feathers, as any wild rock-pigeon! We can understand these facts, on
                        the well-known principle of reversion to ancestral characters, if all the
                        domestic breeds have descended from the rock-pigeon. But if we deny this, we
                        must make one of the two following highly improbable suppositions. Either,
                        firstly, that all the several imagined aboriginal stocks were coloured and
                        marked like the rock-pigeon, although no other existing species is thus
                        coloured and marked, so that in each separate breed there might be a
                        tendency to revert to the very same colours and markings. Or, secondly,
                            <pagebreak xml:id="p26" value="26"/> that each breed, even the purest,
                        has within a dozen or, at most, within a score of generations, been crossed
                        by the rock-pigeon: I say within a dozen or twenty generations, for we know
                        of no fact countenancing the belief that the child ever reverts to some one
                        ancestor, removed by a greater number of generations. In a breed which has
                        been crossed only once with some distinct breed, the tendency to reversion
                        to any character derived from such cross will naturally become less and
                        less, as in each succeeding generation there will be less of the foreign
                        blood; but when there has been no cross with a distinct breed, and there is
                        a tendency in both parents to revert to a character, which has been lost
                        during some former generation, this tendency, for all that we can see to the
                        contrary, may be transmitted undiminished for an indefinite number of
                        generations. These two distinct cases are often confounded in treatises on
                        inheritance.</p>
                    <p>Lastly, the hybrids or mongrels from between all the domestic breeds of
                        pigeons are perfectly fertile. I can state this from my own observations,
                        purposely made on the most distinct breeds. Now, it is difficult, perhaps
                        impossible, to bring forward one case of the hybrid offspring of two animals
                            <emph>clearly distinct</emph> being themselves perfectly fertile. Some
                        authors believe that long-continued domestication eliminates this strong
                        tendency to sterility: from the history of the dog I think there is some
                        probability in this hypothesis, if applied to species closely related
                        together, though it is unsupported by a single experiment. But to extend the
                        hypothesis so far as to suppose that species, aboriginally as distinct as
                        carriers, tumblers, pouters, and fantails now are, should yield offspring
                        perfectly fertile, <emph>inter se</emph>, seems to me rash in the
                        extreme.</p>
                    <p>From these several reasons, namely, the improbability of man having formerly
                        got seven or eight supposed <pagebreak xml:id="p27" value="27"/> species of
                        pigeons to breed freely under domestication; these supposed species being
                        quite unknown in a wild state, and their becoming nowhere feral; these
                        species having very abnormal characters in certain respects, as compared
                        with all other Columbidœ, though so like in most other respects to the
                        rock-pigeon; the blue colour and various marks occasionally appearing in all
                        the breeds, both when kept pure and when crossed; the mongrel offspring
                        being perfectly fertile;—from these several reasons, taken together, I can
                        feel no doubt that all our domestic breeds have descended from the Columba
                        livia with its geographical sub-species.</p>
                    <p>In favour of this view, I may add, firstly, that <name xml:lang="la">C.
                            livia</name>, or the rock-pigeon, has been found capable of
                        domestication in Europe and in India; and that it agrees in habits and in a
                        great number of points of structure with all the domestic breeds. Secondly,
                        although an English carrier or short-faced tumbler differs immensely in
                        certain characters from the rock-pigeon, yet by comparing the several
                        sub-breeds of these breeds, more especially those brought from distant
                        countries, we can make an almost perfect series between the extremes of
                        structure. Thirdly, those characters which are mainly distinctive of each
                        breed, for instance the wattle and length of beak of the carrier, the
                        shortness of that of the tumbler, and the number of tail-feathers in the
                        fantail, are in each breed eminently variable; and the explanation of this
                        fact will be obvious when we come to treat of selection. Fourthly, pigeons
                        have been watched, and tended with the utmost care, and loved by many
                        people. They have been domesticated for thousands of years in several
                        quarters of the world; the earliest known record of pigeons is in the fifth
                        Œgyptian dynasty, about 3000 B.C., as was pointed out to me by Professor
                            <name>Lepsius</name>; but <name>Mr. Birch</name> informs me that pigeons
                        are given in a bill</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p28" value="28"/>
                    <p>of fare in the previous dynasty. In the time of the Romans, as we hear from
                        Pliny, immense prices were given for pigeons; <quote>"nay, they are come to
                            this pass, that they can reckon up their pedigree and race."</quote>
                        Pigeons were much valued by <name>Akber Khan</name> in India, about the year
                            <time>1600</time>; never less than 20,000 pigeons were taken with the
                        court. <quote>"The monarchs of Iran and Turan sent him some very rare
                            birds;"</quote> and, continues the courtly historian, <quote>"His
                            Majesty by crossing the breeds, which method was never practised before,
                            has improved them astonishingly."</quote> About this same period the
                        Dutch were as eager about pigeons as were the old Romans. The paramount
                        importance of these considerations in explaining the immense amount of
                        variation which pigeons have undergone, will be obvious when we treat of
                        Selection. We shall then, also, see how it is that the breeds so often have
                        a somewhat monstrous character. It is also a most favourable circumstance
                        for the production of distinct breeds, that male and female pigeons can be
                        easily mated for life; and thus different breeds can be kept together in the
                        same aviary.</p>
                    <p>I have discussed the probable origin of domestic pigeons at some, yet quite
                        insufficient, length; because when I first kept pigeons and watched the
                        several kinds, knowing well how true they bred, I felt fully as much
                        difficulty in believing that they could ever have descended from a common
                        parent, as any naturalist could in coming to a similar conclusion in regard
                        to the many species of finches, or other large groups of birds, in nature.
                        One circumstance has struck me much; namely, that all the breeders of the
                        various domestic animals and the cultivators of plants, with whom I have
                        ever conversed, or whose treatises I have read, are firmly convinced that
                        the several breeds to which each has attended, are descended from so many
                        aboriginally distinct species.</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p29" value="29"/>
                    <p>Ask, as I have asked, a celebrated raiser of Hereford cattle, whether his
                        cattle might not have descended from long-horns, and he will laugh you to
                        scorn. I have never met a pigeon, or poultry, or duck, or rabbit fancier,
                        who was not fully convinced that each main breed was descended from a
                        distinct species. Van Mons, in his treatise on pears and apples, shows how
                        utterly he disbelieves that the several sorts, for instance a Ribston-pippin
                        or Codlin-apple, could ever have proceeded from the seeds of the same tree.
                        Innumerable other examples could be given. The explanation, I think, is
                        simple: from long-continued study they are strongly impressed with the
                        differences between the several races; and though they well know that each
                        race varies slightly, for they win their prizes by selecting such slight
                        differences, yet they ignore all general arguments, and refuse to sum up in
                        their minds slight differences accumulated during many successive
                        generations. May not those naturalists who, knowing far less of the laws of
                        inheritance than does the breeder, and knowing no more than he does of the
                        intermediate links in the long lines of descent, yet admit that many of our
                        domestic races have descended from the same parents—may they not learn a
                        lesson of caution, when they deride the idea of species in a state of nature
                        being lineal descendants of other species?</p>
                    <p><emph>Selection</emph>.—Let us now briefly consider the steps by which
                        domestic races have been produced, either from one or from several allied
                        species. Some little effect may, perhaps, be attributed to the direct action
                        of the external conditions of life, and some little to habit; but he would
                        be a bold man who would account by such agencies for the differences of a
                        dray and race horse, a greyhound and bloodhound, a carrier and tumbler
                        pigeon. One of the most remarkable features in our domesticated races
                            <pagebreak xml:id="p30" value="30"/> is that we see in them adaptation,
                        not indeed to the animal's or plant's own good, but to man's use or fancy.
                        Some variations useful to him have probably arisen suddenly, or by one step;
                        many botanists, for instance, believe that the fuller's teazle, with its
                        hooks, which cannot be rivalled by any mechanical contrivance, is only a
                        variety of the wild Dipsacus; and this amount of change may have suddenly
                        arisen in a seedling. So it has probably been with the turnspit dog; and
                        this is known to have been the case with the ancon sheep. But when we
                        compare the dray-horse and race-horse, the dromedary and camel, the various
                        breeds of sheep fitted either for cultivated land or mountain pasture, with
                        the wool of one breed good for one purpose, and that of another breed for
                        another purpose; when we compare the many breeds of dogs, each good for man
                        in very different ways; when we compare the game-cock, so pertinacious in
                        battle, with other breeds so little quarrelsome, with "everlasting layers"
                        which never desire to sit, and with the bantam so small and elegant; when we
                        compare the host of agricultural, culinary, orchard, and flower-garden races
                        of plants, most useful to man at different seasons and for different
                        purposes, or so beautiful in his eyes, we must, I think, look further than
                        to mere variability. We cannot suppose that all the breeds were suddenly
                        produced as perfect and as useful as we now see them; indeed, in several
                        cases, we know that this has not been their history. The key is man's power
                        of accumulative selection: nature gives successive variations; man adds them
                        up in certain directions useful to him. In this sense he may be said to make
                        for himself useful breeds.</p>
                    <p>The great power of this principle of selection is not hypothetical. It is
                        certain that several of our eminent breeders have, even within a single
                        lifetime, modified to <pagebreak xml:id="p31" value="31"/> a large extent
                        some breeds of cattle and sheep. In order fully to realise what they have
                        done, it is almost necessary to read several of the many treatises devoted
                        to this subject, and to inspect the animals. Breeders habitually speak of an
                        animal's organisation as something quite plastic, which they can model
                        almost as they please. If I had space I could quote numerous passages to
                        this effect from highly competent authorities. Youatt, who was probably
                        better acquainted with the works of agriculturalists than almost any other
                        individual, and who was himself a very good judge of an animal, speaks of
                        the principle of selection as "that which enables the agriculturist, not
                        only to modify the character of his flock, but to change it altogether. It
                        is the magician's wand, by means of which he may summon into life whatever
                        form and mould he pleases." Lord Somerville, speaking of what breeders have
                        done for sheep, says:—"It would seem as if they had chalked out upon a wall
                        a form perfect in itself, and then had given it existence." That most
                        skilful breeder, Sir John Sebright, used to say, with respect to pigeons,
                        that "he would produce any given feather in three years, but it would take
                        him six years to obtain head and beak." In Saxony the importance of the
                        principle of selection in regard to merino sheep is so fully recognised,
                        that men follow it as a trade: the sheep are placed on a table and are
                        studied, like a picture by a connoisseur; this is done three times at
                        intervals of months, and the sheep are each time marked and classed, so that
                        the very best may ultimately be selected for breeding.</p>
                    <p>What English breeders have actually effected is proved by the enormous prices
                        given for animals with a good pedigree; and these have now been exported to
                        almost every quarter of the world. The improvement is by no means generally
                        due to crossing different breeds; <pagebreak xml:id="p32" value="32"/> all
                        the best breeders are strongly opposed to this practice, except sometimes
                        amongst closely allied sub-breeds. And when a cross has been made, the
                        closest selection is far more indispensable even than in ordinary cases. If
                        selection consisted merely in separating some very distinct variety, and
                        breeding from it, the principle would be so obvious as hardly to be worth
                        notice; but its importance consists in the great effect produced by the
                        accumulation in one direction, during successive generations, of differences
                        absolutely inappreciable by an uneducated eye—differences which I for one
                        have vainly attempted to appreciate. Not one man in a thousand has accuracy
                        of eye and judgment sufficient to become an eminent breeder. If gifted with
                        these qualities, and he studies his subject for years, and devotes his
                        lifetime to it with indomitable perseverance, he will succeed, and may make
                        great improvements; if he wants any of these qualities, he will assuredly
                        fail. Few would readily believe in the natural capacity and years of
                        practice requisite to become even a skilful pigeon-fancier.</p>
                    <p>The same principles are followed by horticulturists; but the variations are
                        here often more abrupt. No one supposes that our choicest productions have
                        been produced by a single variation from the aboriginal stock. We have
                        proofs that this is not so in some cases, in which exact records have been
                        kept; thus, to give a very trifling instance, the steadily-increasing size
                        of the common gooseberry may be quoted. We see an astonishing improvement in
                        many florists' flowers, when the flowers of the present day are compared
                        with drawings made only twenty or thirty years ago. When a race of plants is
                        once pretty well established, the seed-raisers do not pick out the best
                        plants, but merely go over their seed-beds, and pull up the "rogues," as
                        they call the plants that deviate from the proper standard. With animals
                        this <pagebreak xml:id="p33" value="33"/> kind of selection is, in fact,
                        also followed; for hardly any one is so careless as to allow his worst
                        animals to breed.</p>
                    <p>In regard to plants, there is another means of observing the accumulated
                        effects of selection—namely, by comparing the diversity of flowers in the
                        different varieties of the same species in the flower-garden; the diversity
                        of leaves, pods, or tubers, or whatever part is valued, in the
                        kitchen-garden, in comparison with the flowers of the same varieties; and
                        the diversity of fruit of the same species in the orchard, in comparison
                        with the leaves and flowers of the same set of varieties. See how different
                        the leaves of the cabbage are, and how extremely alike the flowers; how
                        unlike the flowers of the heartsease are, and how alike the leaves; how much
                        the fruit of the different kinds of gooseberries differ in size, colour,
                        shape, and hairiness, and yet the flowers present very slight differences.
                        It is not that the varieties which differ largely in some one point do not
                        differ at all in other points; this is hardly ever, perhaps never, the case.
                        The laws of correlation of growth, the importance of which should never be
                        overlooked, will ensure some differences; but, as a general rule, I cannot
                        doubt that the continued selection of slight variations, either in the
                        leaves, the flowers, or the fruit, will produce races differing from each
                        other chiefly in these characters.</p>
                    <p>It may be objected that the principle of selection has been reduced to
                        methodical practice for scarcely more than three-quarters of a century; it
                        has certainly been more attended to of late years, and many treatises have
                        been published on the subject; and the result, I may add, has been, in a
                        corresponding degree, rapid and important. But it is very far from true that
                        the principle is a modern discovery. I could give several references to the
                        full acknowledgment of the importance of the principle in works of high
                        antiquity. In rude and <pagebreak xml:id="p34" value="34"/> barbarous
                        periods of English history choice animals were often imported, and laws were
                        passed to prevent their exportation: the destruction of horses under a
                        certain size was ordered, and this may be compared to the "roguing" of
                        plants by nurserymen. The principle of selection I find distinctly given in
                        an ancient Chinese encyclopœdia. Explicit rules are laid down by some of the
                        Roman classical writers. From passages in Genesis, it is clear that the
                        colour of domestic animals was at that early period attended to. Savages now
                        sometimes cross their dogs with wild canine animals, to improve the breed,
                        and they formerly did so, as is attested by passages in Pliny. The savages
                        in South Africa match their draught cattle by colour, as do some of the
                        Esquimaux their teams of dogs. <name>Livingstone</name> shows how much good
                        domestic breeds are valued by the negroes of the interior of Africa who have
                        not associated with Europeans. Some of these facts do not show actual
                        selection, but they show that the breeding of domestic animals was carefully
                        attended to in ancient times, and is now attended to by the lowest savages.
                        It would, indeed, have been a strange fact, had attention not been paid to
                        breeding, for the inheritance of good and bad qualities is so obvious.</p>
                    <p>At the present time, eminent breeders try by methodical selection, with a
                        distinct object in view, to make a new strain or sub-breed, superior to
                        anything existing in the country. But, for our purpose, a kind of Selection,
                        which may be called Unconscious, and which results from every one trying to
                        possess and breed from the best individual animals, is more important. Thus,
                        a man who intends keeping pointers naturally tries to get as good dogs as he
                        can, and afterwards breeds from his own best dogs, but he has no wish or
                        expectation of permanently altering the breed. Nevertheless I cannot
                            <pagebreak xml:id="p35" value="35"/> doubt that this process, continued
                        during centuries, would improve and modify any breed, in the same way as
                            <name>Bakewell</name>, <name>Collins</name>, &amp;c., by this very
                        same process, only carried on more methodically, did greatly modify, even
                        during their own lifetimes, the forms and qualities of their cattle. Slow
                        and insensible changes of this kind could never be recognised unless actual
                        measurements or careful drawings of the breeds in question had been made
                        long ago, which might serve for comparison. In some cases, however,
                        unchanged or but little changed individuals of the same breed may be found
                        in less civilised districts, where the breed has been less improved. There
                        is reason to believe that King Charles's spaniel has been unconsciously
                        modified to a large extent since the time of that monarch. Some highly
                        competent authorities are convinced that the setter is directly derived from
                        the spaniel, and has probably been slowly altered from it. It is known that
                        the English pointer has been greatly changed within the last century, and in
                        this case the change has, it is believed, been chiefly effected by crosses
                        with the fox-hound; but what concerns us is, that the change has been
                        effected unconsciously and gradually, and yet so effectually, that, though
                        the old Spanish pointer certainly came from Spain, <name>Mr. Borrow</name>
                        has not seen, as I am informed by him, any native dog in Spain like our
                        pointer.</p>
                    <p>By a similar process of selection, and by careful training, the whole body of
                        English racehorses have come to surpass in fleetness and size the parent
                        Arab stock, so that the latter, by the regulations for the Goodwood Races,
                        are favoured in the weights they carry. Lord Spencer and others have shown
                        how the cattle of England have increased in weight and in early maturity,
                        compared with the stock formerly kept in this country. By comparing the
                        accounts given in old pigeon treatises of carriers <pagebreak xml:id="p36"
                            value="36"/> and tumblers with these breeds as now existing in Britain,
                        India, and Persia, we can, I think, clearly trace the stages through which
                        they have insensibly passed, and come to differ so greatly from the
                        rock-pigeon.</p>
                    <p>Youatt gives an excellent illustration of the effects of a course of
                        selection, which may be considered as unconsciously followed, in so far that
                        the breeders could never have expected or even have wished to have produced
                        the result which ensued—namely, the production of two distinct strains. The
                        two flocks of Leicester sheep kept by Mr. Buckley and Mr. Burgess, as Mr.
                        Youatt remarks, "have been purely bred from the original stock of Mr.
                        Bakewell for upwards of fifty years. There is not a suspicion existing in
                        the mind of any one at all acquainted with the subject that the owner of
                        either of them has deviated in any one instance from the pure blood of Mr.
                        Bakewell's flock, and yet the difference between the sheep possessed by
                        these two gentlemen is so great that they have the appearance of being quite
                        different varieties."</p>
                    <p>If there exist savages so barbarous as never to think of the inherited
                        character of the offspring of their domestic animals, yet any one animal
                        particularly useful to them, for any special purpose, would be carefully
                        preserved during famines and other accidents, to which savages are so
                        liable, and such choice animals would thus generally leave more offspring
                        than the inferior ones; so that in this case there would be a kind of
                        unconscious selection going on. We see the value set on animals even by the
                        barbarians of Tierra del Fuego, by their killing and devouring their old
                        women, in times of dearth, as of less value than their dogs.</p>
                    <p>In plants the same gradual process of improvement, through the occasional
                        preservation of the best individuals, whether or not sufficiently distinct
                        to be ranked</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p37" value="37"/>
                    <p>at their first appearance as distinct varieties, and whether or not two or
                        more species or races have become blended together by crossing, may plainly
                        be recognised in the increased size and beauty which we now see in the
                        varieties of the heartsease, rose, pelargonium, dahlia, and other plants,
                        when compared with the older varieties or with their parent-stocks. No one
                        would ever expect to get a first-rate heartsease or dahlia from the seed of
                        a wild plant. No one would expect to raise a first-rate melting pear from
                        the seed of the wild pear, though he might succeed from a poor seedling
                        growing wild, if it had come from a garden-stock. The pear, though
                        cultivated in classical times, appears, from Pliny's description, to have
                        been a fruit of very inferior quality. I have seen great surprise expressed
                        in horticultural works at the wonderful skill of gardeners, in having
                        produced such splendid results from such poor materials; but the art, I
                        cannot doubt, has been simple, and, as far as the final result is concerned,
                        has been followed almost unconsciously. It has consisted in always
                        cultivating the best known variety, sowing its seeds, and, when a slightly
                        better variety has chanced to appear, selecting it, and so onwards. But the
                        gardeners of the classical period, who cultivated the best pear they could
                        procure, never thought what splendid fruit we should eat; though we owe our
                        excellent fruit, in some small degree, to their having naturally chosen and
                        preserved the best varieties they could anywhere find.</p>
                    <p>A large amount of change in our cultivated plants, thus slowly and
                        unconsciously accumulated, explains, as I believe, the well-known fact, that
                        in a vast number of cases we cannot recognise, and therefore do not know,
                        the wild parent-stocks of the plants which have been longest cultivated in
                        our flower and kitchen gardens. If it has taken centuries or thousands of
                        years to improve</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p38" value="38"/>
                    <p>or modify most of our plants up to their present standard of usefulness to
                        man, we can understand how it is that neither Australia, the Cape of Good
                        Hope, nor any other region inhabited by quite uncivilised man, has afforded
                        us a single plant worth culture. It is not that these countries, so rich in
                        species, do not by a strange chance possess the aboriginal stocks of any
                        useful plants, but that the native plants have not been improved by
                        continued selection up to a standard of perfection comparable with that
                        given to the plants in countries anciently civilised.</p>
                    <p>In regard to the domestic animals kept by uncivilised man, it should not be
                        overlooked that they almost always have to struggle for their own food, at
                        least during certain seasons. And in two countries very differently
                        circumstanced, individuals of the same species, having slightly different
                        constitutions or structure, would often succeed better in the one country
                        than in the other, and thus by a process of "natural selection," as will
                        hereafter be more fully explained, two sub-breeds might be formed. This,
                        perhaps, partly explains what has been remarked by some authors, namely,
                        that the varieties kept by savages have more of the character of species
                        than the varieties kept in civilised countries.</p>
                    <p>On the view here given of the all-important part which selection by man has
                        played, it becomes at once obvious, how it is that our domestic races show
                        adaptation in their structure or in their habits to man's wants or fancies.
                        We can, I think, further understand the frequently abnormal character of our
                        domestic races, and likewise their differences being so great in external
                        characters and relatively so slight in internal parts or organs. Man can
                        hardly select, or only with much difficulty, any deviation of structure
                        excepting such as is externally visible; and indeed he rarely cares for what
                        is internal. He can never act by selection, excepting on variations
                            <pagebreak xml:id="p39" value="39"/> which are first given to him in
                        some slight degree by nature. No man would ever try to make a fantail, till
                        he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual
                        manner, or a pouter till he saw a pigeon with a crop of somewhat unusual
                        size; and the more abnormal or unusual any character was when it first
                        appeared, the more likely it would be to catch his attention. But to use
                        such an expression as trying to make a fantail, is, I have no doubt, in most
                        cases, utterly incorrect. The man who first selected a pigeon with a
                        slightly larger tail, never dreamed what the descendants of that pigeon
                        would become through long-continued, partly unconscious and partly
                        methodical selection. Perhaps the parent bird of all fantails had only
                        fourteen tail-feathers somewhat expanded, like the present Java fantail, or
                        like individuals of other and distinct breeds, in which as many as seventeen
                        tail-feathers have been counted. Perhaps the first pouter-pigeon did not
                        inflate its crop much more than the turbit now does the upper part of its
                        œsophagus,—a habit which is disregarded by all fanciers, as it is not one of
                        the points of the breed.</p>
                    <p>Nor let it be thought that some great deviation of structure would be
                        necessary to catch the fancier's eye: he perceives extremely small
                        differences, and it is in human nature to value any novelty, however slight,
                        in one's own possession. Nor must the value which would formerly be set on
                        any slight differences in the individuals of the same species, be judged of
                        by the value which would now be set on them, after several breeds have once
                        fairly been established. Many slight differences might, and indeed do now,
                        arise amongst pigeons, which are rejected as faults or deviations from the
                        standard of perfection of each breed. The common goose has not given rise to
                        any marked varieties; hence the Thoulouse and the common breed, which differ
                        only in colour, that <pagebreak xml:id="p40" value="40"/> most fleeting of
                        characters, have lately been exhibited as distinct at our poultry-shows.</p>
                    <p>I think these views further explain what has sometimes been noticed—namely
                        that we know nothing about the origin or history of any of our domestic
                        breeds. But, in fact, a breed, like a dialect of a language, can hardly be
                        said to have had a definite origin. A man preserves and breeds from an
                        individual with some slight deviation of structure, or takes more care than
                        usual in matching his best animals and thus improves them, and the improved
                        individuals slowly spread in the immediate neighbourhood. But as yet they
                        will hardly have a distinct name, and from being only slightly valued, their
                        history will be disregarded. When further improved by the same slow and
                        gradual process, they will spread more widely, and will get recognised as
                        something distinct and valuable, and will then probably first receive a
                        provincial name. In semi-civilised countries, with little free
                        communication, the spreading and knowledge of any new sub-breed will be a
                        slow process. As soon as the points of value of the new sub-breed are once
                        fully acknowledged, the principle, as I have called it, of unconscious
                        selection will always tend,—perhaps more at one period than at another, as
                        the breed rises or falls in fashion,—perhaps more in one district than in
                        another, according to the state of civilisation of the inhabitants,—slowly
                        to add to the characteristic features of the breed, whatever they may be.
                        But the chance will be infinitely small of any record having been preserved
                        of such slow, varying, and insensible changes.</p>
                    <p>I must now say a few words on the circumstances, favourable, or the reverse,
                        to man's power of selection. A high degree of variability is obviously
                        favourable, as freely giving the materials for selection to work on; not
                        that mere individual differences are not amply <pagebreak xml:id="p41"
                            value="41"/> sufficient, with extreme care, to allow of the accumulation
                        of a large amount of modification in almost any desired direction. But as
                        variations manifestly useful or pleasing to man appear only occasionally,
                        the chance of their appearance will be much increased by a large number of
                        individuals being kept; and hence this comes to be of the highest importance
                        to success. On this principle Marshall has remarked, with respect to the
                        sheep of parts of Yorkshire, that "as they generally belong to poor people,
                        and are mostly <emph>in</emph>
                        <emph>small lots</emph>, they never can be improved." On the other hand,
                        nurserymen, from raising large stocks of the same plants, are generally far
                        more successful than amateurs in getting new and valuable varieties. The
                        keeping of a large number of individuals of a species in any country
                        requires that the species should be placed under favourable conditions of
                        life, so as to breed freely in that country. When the individuals of any
                        species are scanty, all the individuals, whatever their quality may be, will
                        generally be allowed to breed, and this will effectually prevent selection.
                        But probably the most important point of all, is, that the animal or plant
                        should be so highly useful to man, or so much valued by him, that the
                        closest attention should be paid to even the slightest deviation in the
                        qualities or structure of each individual. Unless such attention be paid
                        nothing can be effected. I have seen it gravely remarked, that it was most
                        fortunate that the strawberry began to vary just when gardeners began to
                        attend closely to this plant. No doubt the strawberry had always varied
                        since it was cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected. As
                        soon, however, as gardeners picked out individual plants with slightly
                        larger, earlier, or better fruit, and raised seedlings from them, and again
                        picked out the best seedlings and bred from them, then, there appeared
                        (aided by some <pagebreak xml:id="p42" value="42"/> crossing with distinct
                        species) those many admirable varieties of the strawberry which have been
                        raised during the last thirty or forty years.</p>
                    <p>In the case of animals with separate sexes, facility in preventing crosses is
                        an important element of success in the formation of new races,—at least, in
                        a country which is already stocked with other races. In this respect
                        enclosure of the land plays a part. Wandering savages or the inhabitants of
                        open plains rarely possess more than one breed of the same species. Pigeons
                        can be mated for life, and this is a great convenience to the fancier, for
                        thus many races may be kept true, though mingled in the same aviary; and
                        this circumstance must have largely favoured the improvement and formation
                        of new breeds. Pigeons, I may add, can be propagated in great numbers and at
                        a very quick rate, and inferior birds may be freely rejected, as when killed
                        they serve for food. On the other hand, cats, from their nocturnal rambling
                        habits, cannot be matched, and, although so much valued by women and
                        children, we hardly ever see a distinct breed kept up; such breeds as we do
                        sometimes see are almost always imported from some other country, often from
                        islands. Although I do not doubt that some domestic animals vary less than
                        others, yet the rarity or absence of distinct breeds of the cat, the donkey,
                        peacock, goose, &amp;c., may be attributed in main part to selection not
                        having been brought into play: in cats, from the difficulty in pairing them;
                        in donkeys, from only a few being kept by poor people, and little attention
                        paid to their breeding; in peacocks, from not being very easily reared and a
                        large stock not kept; in geese, from being valuable only for two purposes,
                        food and feathers, and more especially from no pleasure having been felt in
                        the display of distinct breeds.</p>
                    <pagebreak xml:id="p43" value="43"/>
                    <p>To sum up on the origin of our Domestic Races of animals and plants. I
                        believe that the conditions of life, from their action on the reproductive
                        system, are so far of the highest importance as causing variability. I do
                        not believe that variability is an inherent and necessary contingency, under
                        all circumstances, with all organic beings, as some authors have thought.
                        The effects of variability are modified by various degrees of inheritance
                        and of reversion. Variability is governed by many unknown laws, more
                        especially by that of correlation of growth. Something may be attributed to
                        the direct action of the conditions of life. Something must be attributed to
                        use and disuse. The final result is thus rendered infinitely complex. In
                        some cases, I do not doubt that the intercrossing of species, aboriginally
                        distinct, has played an important part in the origin of our domestic
                        productions. When in any country several domestic breeds have once been
                        established, their occasional intercrossing, with the aid of selection, has,
                        no doubt, largely aided in the formation of new sub-breeds; but the
                        importance of the crossing of varieties has, I believe, been greatly
                        exaggerated, both in regard to animals and to those plants which are
                        propagated by seed. In plants which are temporarily propagated by cuttings,
                        buds, &amp;c., the importance of the crossing both of distinct species
                        and of varieties is immense; for the cultivator here quite disregards the
                        extreme variability both of hybrids and mongrels, and the frequent sterility
                        of hybrids; but the cases of plants not propagated by seed are of little
                        importance to us, for their endurance is only temporary. Over all these
                        causes of Change I am convinced that the accumulative action of Selection,
                        whether applied methodically and more quickly, or unconsciously and more
                        slowly, but more efficiently, is by far the predominant Power.</p>
