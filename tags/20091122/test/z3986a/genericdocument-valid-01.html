            <h>Chapter 1: The beginning of everything</h>                
            <section xml:id="sec2">
                <h>A little bit of the beginning</h>
                <p>As this is only <z:noteref ref="nn">1</z:noteref> a little bit of the beginning, it can't be too long. But small as
                    it is, it must be possible to <em>emphasize</em> what you mean, and even use
                    some <strong>strong</strong> language, if that feels natural.</p>
                <p>And I can't see why a little bit of the beginning can't contain a list, so here
                    it is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This is an <em>important</em> point to state.</li>
                    <li>And so is <strong>this</strong>!</li>
                    <li>But this is the final and most important one!!!</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And that list marks the end of this section.</p>
                <pre>pre</pre>

                <h>Almost the end</h>
                <p>My brain has stopped working. I can't find anything sensible to write in this paragraph.</p>
