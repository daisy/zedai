  <p>The Z39.86-2011 Newsfeed Aggregator Profile is intended to serve as an XML republishing format
   for syndicated web content, primarily <em>news</em>.</p>
  
  <p>The profile intends to capture input sources served in formats such as <a
    href="http://www.iptc.org/">NewsML</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4287">Atom</a>,
    <a href="http://www.iptc.org/">NITF</a> and <a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification"
    >RSS</a> in a single format, using markup that is economic to produce but still rich enough to
   allow transformation to various accessible formats (such as Braille, DAISY and large print).</p>
  
  <p>The profile is designed to address the following usage contexts:</p>
  <ul>
   <li>The supply of an article, a collection of articles, or an entire publication in a light-weight XML grammar.</li>
   <li>The aggregation of articles from various publications, possibly using disparate formats, in a light-weight XML grammar.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The profile allows the expression of document-wide as well as article-level metadata. A set of <a href="##h_defaultrdfvocabulary">terms</a> has been defined
   to allow the metadata to describe both properties of the source material as well as the intended output.</p>
  
  <p>Although the profile is primarily intended to be used in automated aggregation and republishing
   contexts, it does not exclude use in manual authoring environments.</p>
