                    ANNOTATION
    -->

    <section about="z3986.annotation">
        <para role="desc"> The {annotation} element represents an annotation that an author, editor,
            publisher, republisher, or other individual or agency has added to a document. </para>
        <para role="info">The {[[#z3986.ref.attrib]]} attribute identifies the specific element(s)
            being annotated by referencing their {xml:id} values.</para>
        <para role="info">All {annotation} elements must reference at least one element in a
            document. For annotations that apply to more than one element, use a space-separated
            list of {xml:id} values.</para>
        <para role="info">REMARK: the design of this element is not yet stable. Refer to <link

    <!--
                    CITATION
    -->

    <section about="z3986.citation">
        <para role="desc">The {citation} element represents an author's acknowledgment of the
            original author and/or work of a directly or indirectly borrowed idea, quote or other
            resource. Citations typically occur in conjunction with epigraphs, quotes,
            illustrations, charts and diagrams.</para>
        <para role="info">The optional {[[#z3986.ref.attrib]]} attribute on the {citation} element
            is used to establish an explicit association between the citation and the passage
            (epigraph, quote, etc.) that constitutes the quotation. No other means for establishing
            this association is available; the placement of the {citation} does not imply the
            location of the passage being cited.</para>
        <para role="info">The {citation} can also be linked to the work it cites by including a
            {[[#z3986.ref]]} element. A {[[#z3986.ref.attrib]]} attribute can be attached to the
            nested {ref} element to reference a work in the current document's
            {[[#z3986.bibliography]]}. To reference other resources, including resources external to
            the current document, the {[[#xlink.href.attrib]]} attribute must be used
            instead.</para>
    </section>



    <!--
                    CODE
    -->

    <section about="z3986.code">
        <para role="desc"> The {code} element is intended for general instances of code as found in
            works of fiction and similar non-technical documents, which includes computer
            programming code, commands and command input/output as well as representations of
            numeric and text coding systems, such as Morse code. </para>
        <para role="info"> For computer programming books, manuals and specifications, specializing
            the {code} element or using a computer markup feature is recommended. </para>
    </section>




    <!--
                    CUSTOM-CONTENT
    -->

    <section about="z3986.custom-content">
        <para role="info"> The republishing of documents often requires the insertion of content
            that was not a part of the original source document. For example, in the case of
            indexes, bibliographies and other ordered sections, this requirement may take the form
            of placeholder sections to mark gaps in the alphabetic list of entries. To indicate that
            an element presents content that is a deviation from the source, the
            {[[#z3986.role.attrib]]} attribute can be used with the value {custom}. No behaviors are
            defined for how a processing agent should handle sections so identified, however.

    <!--
                    GLOSSARY
    -->

    <section about="z3986.glossary">
        <para role="desc"> The {glossary} element represents a glossary, pronunciation guide or
            other section that exclusively defines terms or phrases. </para>
    </section>





    <!--
                    ITEM
    -->

    <section about="z3986.list.item">
        <para role="desc"> The {item} element represents a single item in a list. </para>
    </section>


    <!--
                    LIST
    -->

    <section about="z3986.list">
        <para role="desc"> The {list} element represents a simple list of items, either ordered or
            unordered. </para>
        <para role="info"> The optional {type} attribute specifies the HTML-style ordered and
            unordered nature of the list.</para>
        <para role="info"> By default, an unordered list is prefixed by bullets and an ordered list
            by numeric values. To change this behavior, refer to the {rend:prefix} attribute. </para>
        <para role="info">If the {type} attribute is omitted, then there is no default
            formatting.</para>
        <para role="info">The {list} element is not intended to structure semantically meaningful
            sets of entries as found in indexes, bibliographies and glossaries.</para>
    </section>


    <!--
                    OBJECT
    -->

    <section about="z3986.object">
        <para role="desc"> The {object} element contains a reference to an external resource, such
            as a graphic or video. </para>
        <para role="info">The formal behavior of the {object} element is defined by
            {[[http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11 XHTML 1.1]]}.</para>
        <para role="info">The referenced resource may be an image, video, XML text, or other
            content, but its media type must be supported by the current profile and features in
            use. The optional {srctype} attribute carries an enumeration of the allowed media
            types.</para>
        <para role="info">REMARK: the design of this element is not yet stable. Refer to <link
            xlink:href="http://code.google.com/p/zednext/issues/detail?id=153">Issue

    </section>


    <!--
                    QUOTE
    -->

    <section about="z3986.quote">
        <para role="desc">The {quote} element represents a quotation from a real or fictitious
            source.</para>

        <para role="info">The {[[#z3986.role.attrib]]} attribute optionally expresses the semantic
            nature of the quote. For example, adding the value 'epigraph' would indicate the quote
            represents an epigraph for the document or section it belongs to.</para>

    </section>

    <section about="z3986.quote.characters">
        <para role="info"> Quotation marks should be included within the element if they must be
            retained in the file. The use of CSS for appending these characters is recommended,
            however, for the flexibility it allows to change the characters depending on the desired
            output. </para>
    </section>


    <!--
                    TOC
    -->

    <section about="z3986.toc">
        <para role="desc">The {toc} element represents a single table of contents in a
            document.</para>
        <para role="info">The term "table of contents" is a generalization encompassing all of
            tables of contents, tables of figures, tables of maps and similar guides to the contents
            of a document.</para>
